I'm going to go back tomorrow and get one. It will be perfect for the left side of our bookshelf'. Bill goes and visits his friend. Bill and his friend talk for a while, and when Bill asks if his friend is willing to sell the bookend, his friend is happy to sell it. Bill makes an offer, but his friend insists on him not paying so much. Finally, Bill buys the right-side Bartlett bookend from his friend and goes home. Then the next day, Sue goes and buys the left-side Bartlett bookend. So, when Sue got home, they had the paired set of bookends.",
    "query": "Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set of bookends?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation**: Bill's purchase of the right-side Bartlett bookend was a necessary and direct cause of the paired set. While Sue independently intended to acquire the left-side bookend, the pair could only exist if both the left and right components were present. Without Bill’s action, Sue’s purchase alone would have resulted in an incomplete set. Thus, Bill’s decision to buy the right-side bookend played a critical causal role in enabling the outcome (the paired set).",

    "story": "In a high-tech greenhouse, an irrigation system is designed to deliver water efficiently without causing any flooding. There are two key valves controlling water flow: the primary valve, which is programmed to open during scheduled watering periods, and the emergency override valve, which should only be used during unexpected situations to manually release water. If both valves are open at the same time, the system becomes overwhelmed, and flooding occurs. One afternoon, during maintenance work, a technician accidentally leaves the primary valve open while also testing the emergency override valve. As a result, the irrigation system overflows, causing flooding in the greenhouse.",
    "query": "Did the main water supply valve being opened cause the flooding?",
    "response": "Answer (Yes or No?): Yes  \n**Explanation**: The flooding occurred because both valves were open simultaneously. If the primary valve (main water supply) had not been open, the emergency override valve alone would not have overwhelmed the system, per the story's setup. Thus, the primary valve being open was a necessary condition for the flooding, satisfying the counterfactual criterion for actual causation. Both valves' simultaneous operation was required, making the primary valve a cause.",

    "story": "Emma, an aspiring pastry chef, owns a charming bakery well known in her town. Among her specialties are exquisite cakes and cookies, which she is determined to make even more delicious. Mia and Liam, her two assistants, help her with various tasks, from baking to decorating. Emma recently attended a baking workshop and learned from an expert that using premium flavor enhancers like PremiumVanilla Extract Z1 or ChocolateBoost Concentrate C2 can elevate desserts significantly. However, she also learned that mixing these enhancers in the same recipe can lead to an overpowering and unpleasant taste. Back at the bakery, Emma decides to stick exclusively to PremiumVanilla Extract Z1 and informs Mia and Liam about the plan. She also asks Mia to purchase several bottles of PremiumVanilla Extract Z1 to ensure they have enough supply. Days later, while sampling her desserts, Emma is thrilled to find that some have a richer, more delightful flavor than before. However, she nearly spits out one batch of cookies, which taste bitter instead of sweet. Emma's curiosity turns to concern, and she approaches Mia and Liam to investigate. Mia confidently states, \"I funneled PremiumVanilla Extract Z1 into the yellow bottle and have been using it solely in recipes.\" Liam, on the other hand, looks puzzled: \"But I always used the blue bottle. Mia, you said you'd filled PremiumVanilla Extract Z1 in the blue bottle, didn’t you?\" Mia pauses and replies sheepishly, \"Oh no, I might have made a mistake. I'm truly sorry, Liam.\" This confession sparks Emma's memory: before attending the workshop, she had set aside ChocolateBoost Concentrate C2 in a blue bottle but had not told anyone about it. Liam seems shaken to realize that he had unknowingly used ChocolateBoost Concentrate C2. Emma concludes that the bitter-tasting cookies came from recipes where both flavor enhancers were accidentally combined.",
    "query": "Did the use of PremiumVanilla Extract Z1 by Mia cause the desserts to taste bitter?",
    "response": "Answer: No.\n\n**Explanation:** The bitter taste resulted from the **combination** of both PremiumVanilla Extract Z1 (used by Mia) and ChocolateBoost Concentrate C2 (used by Liam due to the blue bottle mix-up). While Mia’s use of Z1 was part of the causal chain, the **direct cause** of the bitterness was the **interaction** between Z1 and C2. Mia’s action alone (using Z1 as instructed) would not have caused bitterness unless paired with C2. The critical factor was Liam’s accidental use of C2, which Mia’s mistake (mislabeling bottles) enabled. Thus, Mia’s use of Z1 was not the **actual cause** of the bitterness; the root cause was the **unintended mixing** of both enhancers.",

Sam, the head baker, has a routine task of preheating the industrial oven to the optimal temperature before starting any dough preparation. This oven is essential, as it ensures the bread rises perfectly during baking. Emma, a cashier at the bakery, helps in managing customers and sometimes observes how the baking equipment works. While Emma understands the steps to preheat the oven, this task is strictly assigned to Sam. One busy morning, Sam was distracted by a phone call from a supplier and completely forgot to preheat the oven. Unaware of Sam's oversight, Emma remained focused on customer transactions and didn’t step in to check the oven’s status. Consequently, the dough failed to bake properly, and the bakery was unable to sell its usual morning bread, resulting in disappointed customers and a significant loss in revenue.",

The oven's preheating was a necessary step for the bread to rise and bake, and this task was explicitly Sam's responsibility. While Emma did not check the oven, her role did not include this duty, making her inaction a background condition rather than a cause. The critical factor was Sam's oversight, which was both necessary and sufficient for the outcome under the circumstances.

Among her primary duties is ensuring that every bed is watered regularly to maintain the flowers' lush appearance. While Sarah excels at her job, there are times when she is busy managing other tasks in the garden. Emily, another gardener who specializes in trimming hedges and planting, also knows how to water the flower beds, but her job description does not include this responsibility. Early one sunny morning, Sarah had numerous activities to juggle and forgot to water one of the flower beds near the central fountain. Later in the day, Sarah remembered this oversight. Emily, occupied with preparing a new hedge display on the opposite side of the garden, did not notice that a bed had been missed and did not water it herself. By the weekend, the flowers in the neglected bed had wilted, their vibrant colors faded, much to the disappointment of park visitors.",

    "response": "Answer: Yes. \n\n**Explanation**: Sarah's failure to water the flower bed was the critical factor that directly led to the wilting. While Emily *could* have watered the bed, her role did not obligate her to do so, and her inaction was consistent with her responsibilities. In counterfactual terms: If Sarah had watered the bed (her explicit duty), the flowers would not have wilted. Thus, her omission satisfies the criteria for actual causation.",

The orchestra's shared grand piano, located in the main performance hall, is critical for rehearsals and requires precise tuning for every concert. What the members do not realize is that if the piano is played by two people at the same time, it triggers a mechanical fault in the tuning system, causing some keys to go out of tune. To ensure proper use, the conductor set a strict schedule: Tom is authorized to use the piano exclusively in the mornings, while Jack is assigned the afternoons. However, on the morning of an important rehearsal, Jack disregards the schedule and begins playing the piano at 10 am, hoping to perfect his solo. At the same time, Tom, unaware of Jack’s actions, starts his own practice session on the piano. The piano’s tuning mechanism immediately breaks down, leaving some keys badly out of tune and delaying the rehearsal.",

While Tom was authorized to use the piano in the morning, Jack violated the schedule by playing at the same time as Tom. Both actions (Tom and Jack playing together) were necessary for the mechanical fault to occur. In actual causality, Jack's decision to play during Tom's scheduled time was a critical contributing factor, as the failure would not have happened without his concurrent use.

To meet the growing demand, she hires two assistants, Sara and Liam, to help with running the bakery. Emma trusts her assistants to divide the baking tasks and follow her guidance. Recently, Emma has been experimenting with enhancing the flavor of her pastries to make them stand out even more. She reads in a professional pastry guide that flavor enhancers can elevate the taste significantly. The guide suggests SweetBoost S100 and TastePerk T200 as excellent enhancers, but it also warns that mixing the two in the same recipe could result in unpleasant flavors likely to ruin the pastry. Keen to avoid any mishaps, Emma decides that SweetBoost S100 will be exclusively used going forward. She clearly instructs both Sara and Liam to purchase only SweetBoost S100 and ensure no other enhancers are used. Sara, taking the lead, buys a bulk supply of SweetBoost S100 and sets it up in the storeroom for their use. However, Emma begins noticing mixed results with her products over the following weeks. Some pastries taste better than ever, yet others have an unusually strange and unpleasant flavor. Taken aback, she questions her assistants to understand what’s gone wrong. After some hesitation, Liam admits that instead of using SweetBoost S100, he had used leftover packets of TastePerk T200 from his home to avoid waste. Sara confirms that she strictly adhered to Emma’s instructions and only used the enhancer provided at the bakery. Emma connects the dots and realizes the strange-tasting pastries must have been the result of recipes where SweetBoost S100 and TastePerk T200 were inadvertently combined in the same batch.",

These thermostats are connected to the building's central electrical system, which has a safety mechanism to prevent energy overloads. However, the system has a hidden flaw: if two or more thermostats are set to high in overlapping intervals, the central circuit breaker trips and causes a temporary power outage for the entire building. To address this, building management requested that all residents follow a schedule: Mark is advised to set his thermostat to high only during the nighttime hours, while Sarah is advised to do so in the daytime. On a cold winter evening, at 8 pm, Sarah adjusts her smart thermostat to high, deciding it’s too cold despite the guideline. Meanwhile, Mark, unaware of Sarah’s actions, sets his thermostat to high shortly after to warm his apartment. Within moments, the building's power goes out as the system overloads and trips the circuit breaker, affecting all residents.",

While Mark’s action also contributed, Sarah’s decision to set her thermostat to high at 8 pm (outside her scheduled time) created the overlapping condition necessary for the overload.

The coworking space is divided into 15 sections, and Emma and Michael have agreed to split the workload evenly, coordinating their shifts as needed. Lisa is pleased with their performance. Recently, after attending a workshop on workplace wellness, Lisa wanted to ensure the cleaning products used are both effective and safe. Based on recommendations from the workshop, she decided to switch to a cleaning spray called S P300C, known for neutralizing bacteria and leaving a refreshing citrus scent. Lisa also learned that mixing different cleaning sprays in the same area could release irritants harmful to health. Eager to implement the change, Lisa encounters Emma one evening as she finishes her shift. Lisa discusses the benefits of S P300C with Emma and stresses that only this product should be used going forward. Furthermore, Lisa asks Emma to pass on these instructions to Michael, as Lisa wouldn’t see him before his next shift. Emma agrees and even offers to stock enough bottles of S P300C in the storage cabinet for both herself and Michael. Weeks later, Lisa begins noticing an inconsistency in the coworking space. Some sections smell rejuvenated and spotless, while others emit a strange chemical odor. Worse, several employees have reported mild irritation, such as watery eyes and headaches. Alarmed, Lisa gathers Emma and Michael for a discussion. Emma quickly confesses that she accidentally forgot to convey the new rule to Michael. While Emma only used S P300C, Michael explains that he continued using the spray called L Q200T, stored in a plain bottle in the cabinet. It turns out that L Q200T was an older multi-purpose cleaner Michael had relied on previously. After further evaluation, Lisa realizes the problems occurred in sections where sprays S P300C and L Q200T had been used together, releasing problematic fumes.",

As they drove through a neighborhood blanketed in fresh snow, the car skidded on an icy patch while turning a sharp corner, colliding with a tree. Lucy's daughter, who was fastened in the back seat, suffered a serious head injury. From her colleagues to her close friends, everyone knows Lucy's selflessness frequently overrides her personal priorities. While her husband occasionally urges her to set boundaries, Lucy finds it exceptionally difficult to ignore someone in need, especially in moments of urgency.",

    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation:**  \nUsing the **counterfactual (but-for) test**, Lucy's decision to help Alex directly led to her delay, which resulted in the friend driving her daughter. Without this delay, the accident would not have occurred. While the icy road and friend’s actions were intervening factors, they were part of a foreseeable chain of events (e.g., winter driving risks). Lucy’s habitual selflessness and the daycare’s reliance on alternative arrangements further support that her choice was a **substantial factor** in the injury. Thus, under actual causality frameworks, Lucy’s actions qualify as a cause.",

He spends hours researching guinea pig care and even watches videos on how to set up the perfect living environment for them. One day, during his visit to his friend Mason's house, he notices a large, colorful guinea pig cage sitting unused in Mason's storage room. Mason explains that it's a Sunbright cage that he no longer needs and happily offers to give it to Liam. Thrilled, Liam accepts and brings the cage home, proudly setting it up in his room. The next afternoon, Anna, noticing Liam’s excitement, decides to stop by the local pet store. She knows they might need an additional, smaller cage to separate the guinea pigs if needed. Spotting another Sunbright model on sale, she quickly buys it and brings it home. Now their setup feels complete, as they have two matching Sunbright cages ready for their new pet.",

Their task was to create a model rocket as a team, and they made a mutual promise to their teacher: if either one fully completed their assigned part of the task, whether assembling the rocket or decorating it creatively, the teacher would give them both extra credit. Jake, wanting to start strong, spent several hours alone after school cutting out colored patterns and carefully attaching them to the rocket. By the time Sarah visited him that evening, Jake had already transformed the bare rocket into a beautifully decorated model. However, when they later tried to assemble the rocket structure in Sarah’s living room the next day, they found it extremely challenging and ran out of time before completing it. Finally, with only a few minutes left before their project was due, Sarah quickly grabbed the required materials and finished assembling the structure under immense pressure. Their teacher, recognizing how both parts played a role, awarded them the extra credit as promised. Consider how the outcome might change if Jake hadn’t decorated the rocket or if Sarah hadn’t succeeded in assembling it on time.",

In the actual scenario, Jake decorated the rocket, which alone satisfied the condition for extra credit. However, Sarah also completed her part (assembling the rocket). Since the outcome (extra credit) would have occurred even if only one task was completed, **Sarah’s success in assembling the rocket is a sufficient cause** for the outcome.

Both bakers bring their individual flair to the recipes and have the freedom to coordinate their respective workloads. Sarah, always striving for perfection, decides to experiment with upgrading her ingredients. While attending a culinary workshop, she learns that specific premium flours—Golden Wheat Flour or Alpine White Flour—can significantly improve pastry quality. However, chefs at the workshop caution against mixing these specialized flours in the same batch, providing examples of prior mishaps. Inspired but cautious, Sarah resolves to standardize her future recipes by using only Golden Wheat Flour. She discusses this plan with her team and assigns Emma to purchase enough Golden Wheat Flour for everyone. A few weeks into this change, Sarah notices something peculiar—while some pastries are receiving rave customer reviews for their exceptional taste and texture, others are being returned for tasting strangely dense and sour. Concerned about this unexpected outcome, Sarah investigates. Emma assures her that she consistently used Golden Wheat Flour, following instructions. However, Jake admits that he had been secretly using leftover Alpine White Flour in some of his preparations due to a personal preference for its texture. When Sarah connects the incidents, she realizes that the problematic pastries were those made using mixes of both flours, occurring when Emma and Jake unknowingly worked on the same pastry batches.",

    "response": "Answer (Yes or No?): No.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nUnder actual causality frameworks like the \"but-for\" test, we ask: *But for Lily not signaling Marcus, would he have avoided the trap?* However, the game's rules explicitly prohibit Strategists like Lily from communicating with Scouts during gameplay. Since Lily *could not* signal Marcus (due to the constraints of her role), her inaction was not a voluntary or permissible action but a structural limitation of the game. The direct cause of Marcus being out was his interaction with the trap, which occurred because he lacked awareness of it—a consequence of the game's communication restrictions, not Lily's choice. Thus, Lily’s inability to act (rather than her omission) is not the actual cause of the outcome.",

He takes pride in ensuring that every book is returned to its correct spot on the shelves, helping library users find what they need with ease. Part of his role involves checking books left on tables or misplaced by visitors and returning them to their rightful places promptly. Sarah, another librarian in the library's operations team, works mainly with managing membership registrations and assisting new visitors. Despite her different role, Sarah is also trained to locate where all books belong and can take over reshelving duties when needed, especially if John is unavailable or forgets. However, on July 3rd, a particularly busy day due to a local book festival, John neglected to address a pile of books left unshelved. Without noticing, Sarah also failed to step in and reshelve the books. This oversight caused frustration among library users, who struggled to find the materials they needed in the disorganized sections that day.",

Here, both John and Sarah had the responsibility and capacity to reshelve the books. While John's primary role made him the primary responsible party, Sarah's trained role included stepping in when John failed. Her failure to act (despite being capable and expected to do so in his absence) contributed to the outcome. If Sarah had reshelved the books, the users' frustration might have been avoided, making her omission a causal factor.",

During an extra practice session late in the evening, Ava unintentionally leaves a frying pan of oil on maximum heat while distracted by a phone call. At the same time, Liam, focused on preparing another dish, accidentally cranks the heat too high under his frying pan. Ava's oil reaches a critical temperature and ignites into flames, while Liam's pan follows suit moments later due to overheating. The flames from both pans grow uncontrollably, combining into a raging fire that quickly spreads through the tightly confined kitchen space. As a result of the immense heat and pressure from the spreading flames, a gas pipe bursts, leading to a massive kitchen explosion that shakes the entire building.",

Under a counterfactual analysis, if Ava had not acted as she did, the combined intensity of the flames would not have occurred, and the explosion might not have happened (assuming Liam’s fire alone would have been insufficient).

They are responsible for preparing coffee orders and have the flexibility to decide how they split their tasks during their overlapping shifts. After attending a coffee exhibition, Emma was introduced to a new type of coffee bean called Premium Roast 240A, which promises a rich, full-bodied flavor. Emma decides to transition all drink preparations to this new bean to enhance the café's reputation for quality. She discusses this plan with Sarah during the shift change and tells her to make sure the new beans are used exclusively for all orders. Emma instructs Sarah to purchase several bags of Premium Roast 240A and to inform David of the change, so he can follow the same practice on his shift. Sarah immediately agrees but is distracted by a long line of customers and forgets to pass along the message to David. Over the next few weeks, a few regular customers inform Emma about an unusual sour taste in some of their coffee orders. Curious, Emma investigates by sampling multiple drinks during a random visit to her café. She finds that while some drinks taste deliciously smooth and rich, others are overtly sour, with a strong bitter aftertaste. Emma consults Sarah, who admits she neglected to inform David to use the Premium Roast 240A and suspects he has been preparing drinks using the Standard Blend 120B beans that were left over in the café. David confirms this, explaining that he had no idea about the switch and continued with the previous beans stored in the storage area.

They have been working together for over a year, delegated to manage their own schedules and decide how to split their responsibilities. Sarah places great trust in them since she has rarely encountered issues with their work. One morning, Sarah reads an article in an acclaimed baking magazine about the impact of using different types of flour on bread quality. She learns that Type-A flour is highly recommended for achieving light, fluffy textures, while Type-B flour, if combined with Type-A in any batch, can result in poor consistency and doughy bread. Determined to maintain the bakery’s reputation, Sarah resolves to eliminate any possibility of mixing flours and decides that all recipes must exclusively use Type-A flour. She tells James to purchase a large supply of Type-A flour for both him and Lisa and to explicitly inform Lisa that she must use only Type-A for all her tasks. James assures her he will handle it, offering to be responsible for purchasing and passing on the instructions. Weeks later, Sarah notices troubling feedback from customers regarding inconsistent quality in some of her bread.

One weekend, Anna attended an agricultural trade show, hoping to find tools and equipment to improve their farm. During the event, she came across a seller offering a second-hand AquaMax pump that fit their system specifications, and she made the purchase after a brief negotiation. Meanwhile, Jack decided to visit a neighboring farmer to discuss strategies for dealing with the drought. During the visit, Jack learned that the neighbor had recently upgraded their irrigation system and had an unused AquaMax pump available. Seeing the opportunity, Jack bought it on the spot. By the end of the day, both Anna and Jack returned to the farm, each bringing back the AquaMax pump they had acquired. After quickly installing one of the pumps, they confirmed that the irrigation system was operational and began watering their crops, safeguarding them in the nick of time.",
    "query": "Did Anna cause the crops to be able to get watered?",
    "response": "Answer: No.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe crops were saved by installing one AquaMax pump. While Anna acquired a pump, Jack independently obtained another. Since the irrigation system required only one pump, either Anna's or Jack's acquisition alone would have sufficed to achieve the outcome. Even if Anna had not purchased her pump, Jack's action alone would still have ensured the system operated. Under the **but-for causation** standard (where the outcome would not have occurred \"but for\" the action), Anna's purchase was not necessary for the result. Thus, her action did not causally determine the crops being watered.",

The responsibility for preparing sauces has always been Tom's, even though Sarah, a waitress, is familiar with making them from her past experience as a chef's assistant. However, Sarah's priority is serving customers at the tables, not kitchen work. One day, Tom forgets to prepare the garlic butter sauce before the lunch service starts.

His failure to do so on the day in question directly disrupted the sauce supply chain. Even though the shortage occurred three days later, the omission likely reduced the cumulative stock over time (assuming the sauce is replenished daily but not overproduced). If Tom had prepared the sauce that day, the subsequent depletion leading to the Friday shortage might have been avoided.

The two had met at a physical therapy workshop six years earlier, built a close relationship during their shared sessions, and tied the knot three years later. On this particular evening, they planned to celebrate Lily's promotion at a new job by having dinner downtown. Lily booked a rideshare using her phone while Jacob prepared for their outing. They waited on their porch as the car approached. However, upon seeing the mobility scooters on the driveway, the rideshare driver declined the trip, stating that his sedan wasn’t spacious enough to accommodate them. With little time to delay their celebration, they opted to use Jacob’s van, which had been custom-fitted with controls that suited drivers with restricted mobility. They navigated their usual route to the city, which included crossing the Rosedale Bridge, a prominent structure over Brookstone River. Earlier that week, torrential rain had caused significant damage across the region, and the bridge itself had been especially vulnerable to erosion. In fact, it was reported to have nearly collapsed during the storm, but local authorities had yet to close it. Fifteen minutes before their van reached the bridge, the rideshare driver had safely crossed it without noticing any visible issues. Unfortunately, mere minutes before Lily and Jacob arrived, a critical portion of the bridge gave way. Unable to see the hazard at night, they unknowingly drove over the edge, and their van plunged into the river. By the time first responders reached the scene the next morning, both Lily and Jacob had drowned, their van submerged beneath the debris.",

    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation:** The rideshare driver's refusal caused Lily and Jacob to use their van instead of the rideshare. If the driver had accepted the trip, they would have crossed the Rosedale Bridge **15 minutes earlier** (when the bridge was still intact). By refusing, the driver indirectly delayed their travel, placing them on the bridge at the exact moment it collapsed. While the bridge’s structural failure and the authorities’ negligence were direct causes of the collapse, the driver’s refusal was a **but-for cause** of their deaths: the fatal timing of their arrival would not have occurred without this refusal.

To meet the growing demand, she hires two assistants, Sara and Liam, to help with running the bakery. Emma trusts her assistants to divide the baking tasks and follow her guidance. Recently, Emma has been experimenting with enhancing the flavor of her pastries to make them stand out even more. She reads in a professional pastry guide that flavor enhancers can elevate the taste significantly. The guide suggests SweetBoost S100 and TastePerk T200 as excellent enhancers, but it also warns that mixing the two in the same recipe could result in unpleasant flavors likely to ruin the pastry. Keen to avoid any mishaps, Emma decides that SweetBoost S100 will be exclusively used going forward. She clearly instructs both Sara and Liam to purchase only SweetBoost S100 and ensure no other enhancers are used. Sara, taking the lead, buys a bulk supply of SweetBoost S100 and sets it up in the storeroom for their use. However, Emma begins noticing mixed results with her products over the following weeks. Some pastries taste better than ever, yet others have an unusually strange and unpleasant flavor. Taken aback, she questions her assistants to understand what’s gone wrong. After some hesitation, Liam admits that instead of using SweetBoost S100, he had used leftover packets of TastePerk T200 from his home to avoid waste. Sara confirms that she strictly adhered to Emma’s instructions and only used the enhancer provided at the bakery.

To meet the growing demand, she hires two assistants, Sara and Liam, to help with running the bakery. Emma trusts her assistants to divide the baking tasks and follow her guidance. Recently, Emma has been experimenting with enhancing the flavor of her pastries to make them stand out even more. She reads in a professional pastry guide that flavor enhancers can elevate the taste significantly. The guide suggests SweetBoost S100 and TastePerk T200 as excellent enhancers, but it also warns that mixing the two in the same recipe could result in unpleasant flavors likely to ruin the pastry. Keen to avoid any mishaps, Emma decides that SweetBoost S100 will be exclusively used going forward. She clearly instructs both Sara and Liam to purchase only SweetBoost S100 and ensure no other enhancers are used. Sara, taking the lead, buys a bulk supply of SweetBoost S100 and sets it up in the storeroom for their use. However, Emma begins noticing mixed results with her products over the following weeks. Some pastries taste better than ever, yet others have an unusually strange and unpleasant flavor. Taken aback, she questions her assistants to understand what’s gone wrong. After some hesitation, Liam admits that instead of using SweetBoost S100, he had used leftover packets of TastePerk T200 from his home to avoid waste. Sara confirms that she strictly adhered to Emma’s instructions and only used the enhancer provided at the bakery.

Emma recently attended a baking workshop and learned from an expert that using premium flavor enhancers like PremiumVanilla Extract Z1 or ChocolateBoost Concentrate C2 can elevate desserts significantly. However, she also learned that mixing these enhancers in the same recipe can lead to an overpowering and unpleasant taste. Back at the bakery, Emma decides to stick exclusively to PremiumVanilla Extract Z1 and informs Mia and Liam about the plan.

Each chef is assigned to a separate kitchen, ensuring streamlined operations. To meet special customer requests, both chefs occasionally need to use the exclusive high-temperature oven located in the main preparation area. Despite thorough training, it remains undiscovered that using the oven simultaneously leads to overheating, triggering the restaurant's sensitive fire alarm system. To prevent such incidents, the restaurant has a strict schedule: Mark can use the oven only during lunchtime, while Joanna is permitted access only for dinner service. However, on a busy Saturday, ignoring the schedule, Joanna uses the oven at 12 pm to fulfill a VIP luncheon order. Without awareness of Joanna's action, Mark also begins using the oven at the same time to prepare a dish. The simultaneous use immediately causes the oven to overheat, sounding the fire alarm and disrupting the restaurant's carefully orchestrated service.",

Their only backup during emergencies was an old generator that needed at least one special fuel canister, called a Fermon canister, to operate. Unfortunately, when they acquired the generator, it came without any Fermon canisters. One afternoon, Lucas stopped by a hardware store in town while returning from delivering farm produce. There, he spotted a single Fermon canister for sale, which he promptly purchased, knowing how critical it might be. Meanwhile, Emma was visiting a neighbor's farm to borrow some tools. While helping the neighbor sort his barn, she noticed a dusty Fermon canister lying unused in a corner. Although her neighbor explained that he occasionally needed it, Emma decided to take it without asking while he was distracted sorting other items. When they both returned home that evening, they successfully installed the two Fermon canisters in the generator. Since only one canister was necessary for it to function, the generator roared to life, ensuring they were prepared for the next power outage.",

The hedgehog was present when the new rule about pencil use was announced. Therefore, the hedgehog knew about the new norm. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with. However, there were no pencils left in the box. The polar bear could not finish his homework.",

If the bear had not taken pencils (6 times alternately + 1 final time), there would have been pencils remaining for the polar bear, assuming the box initially contained exactly 14 pencils (6 + 6 + 2 taken). While the hedgehog’s impermissible actions also contributed, actual causality hinges on whether the outcome would have been averted absent the bear’s actions. Since the bear’s permissible but causally relevant taking of pencils was necessary for the outcome, the bear is a cause of the problem.",

There are signals on either side of the bridge. Billy's signal is red, so he is supposed to stop and wait. Suzy's signal is green, so she is supposed to drive across immediately. Neither of them realizes that the bridge is on the verge of collapse. If they both drive their trains onto the bridge at the same time, it will collapse. Neither train is heavy enough on its own to break the bridge, but both together will be too heavy for it. Billy decides to ignore his signal and drives his train onto the bridge immediately at the same time that Suzy follows her signal and drives her train onto the bridge. Both trains move onto the bridge at the same time, and at that moment the bridge collapses.",

Both his and Suzy's trains being on the bridge simultaneously were required for the collapse (as neither alone sufficed). However, causal judgment often attributes responsibility to the agent who violated a norm (Billy ignoring the red signal) when their action is a \"but-for\" cause (the collapse would not have occurred without his participation).

    "story": "Sophia owns a bustling café in the heart of the city, popular for its cozy atmosphere and artisan pastries. To keep up with growing customer demand for dietary-friendly options, Sophia decides to introduce a gluten-free pastry line. After researching several types of gluten-free flours, she finds that Z-GF100 and W-GFA1 are highly regarded for their taste and baking quality. However, the guide she consulted strongly warns that mixing multiple gluten-free flours in recipes can trigger unexpected allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. Concerned about customer health and her café's reputation, Sophia decides to use only Z-GF100 and explicitly instructs her two baristas, Emma and Liam, to strictly follow this rule. Emma, who is highly organized, takes the lead and buys an ample supply of Z-GF100 for everyone to use, putting aside clear containers to store it. Meanwhile, Liam, known for his improvisational approach, finds some leftover bags of W-GFA1 in the café's older storage unit. Believing it would save costs to use up these supplies instead of wasting them, he begins using W-GFA1. After a few weeks, feedback from customers is polarizing: while most praise the pastries, several complain of severe allergic reactions after consuming them. This alarm prompts Sophia to look into the matter. Upon investigation, Emma emphasizes that she adhered to using only Z-GF100 as instructed. However, Liam admits to using W-GFA1, mixing it unintentionally with pastries prepared by Emma's process. Sophia is distressed to realize that the allergic reactions occurred only after consuming pastries made with ingredients from both flours, leading her to suspect contamination.",

    "response": "Answer: No.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nEmma strictly followed Sophia's instructions to use only Z-GF100, which was explicitly approved and intended to avoid allergic reactions. The allergic reactions occurred only when Z-GF100 (used by Emma) was unintentionally mixed with W-GF A1 (used by Liam against instructions). While Emma’s use of Z-GF100 was a *necessary condition* for the reactions (as the mix required both flours), actual causality typically focuses on *deviations from norms or instructions* that directly explain the harm. Liam’s decision to use W-GF A1—a prohibited action—was the critical deviation that introduced the risk.

What neither of them knows is that when two lanterns are turned on at the same time, it causes a rare type of nocturnal insect living in the forest to scatter, unintentionally protecting their food supplies from contamination. For environmental preservation, their instructor emphasized lighting rules: Anna is allowed to use her lantern only before midnight, while Mark is restricted to lighting his lantern only after midnight. Mark is explicitly instructed never to use his lantern before midnight as this could disturb the ecosystem. However, tonight at 10 pm, Mark, defying the rules, switches on his lantern to check on his equipment, while Anna also switches on her lantern to write in her journal. As a result, the rare nocturnal insects near their camp are scared away, preventing potential food contamination.",

One Saturday, just after lunch, Sarah received an unexpected call from Mia. Eager to talk, Sarah sat down on her couch and got lost in the conversation about Mia's new life overseas, not realizing she missed the bus she intended to take to her friend's house. Her friend had asked Sarah to water her plants during a vacation, and with no alternate transportation available, Sarah phoned her younger brother, who was relaxing at home, and convinced him to step in for her. While tending to the plants, her brother accidentally stepped on a slippery patch of floor that had become wet from spilled water. The slip caused him to knock over a large decorative lamp, which hit and fractured a water pipe. The broken pipe began leaking, eventually soaking the living room floor and ruining a nearby set of electronic devices, including an expensive home theater system. Sarah's habit of lengthy, engrossing conversations was well-known to those close to her. While it was a trait that often made her seem caring and approachable, it sometimes led her to neglect time-sensitive responsibilities.

Without his involvement, the specific sequence (slipping → lamp falling → pipe rupture → damage) would not have occurred.

Despite being well-intentioned, Linda’s tendency to get caught up in casual conversations occasionally disrupted her workflow and sometimes created cascading delays for her team. Her coworkers viewed it as a double-edged trait; while it fostered camaraderie, it occasionally hindered critical tasks. Even when she tried to focus, she found it hard to break away from engaging with others.",
    "query": "Did the reckless driver cause the report to be damaged?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes  \n**Explanation**: The reckless driver's action directly led to the accident that destroyed the report. While Linda’s delay initiated the chain of events (sending the courier), the driver’s recklessness was the critical intervening cause without which the damage would not have occurred. Under actual causality frameworks like the \"but-for\" test, the damage would not have happened *but for* the driver’s reckless driving, making it a direct and proximate cause.",

The landlord has posted a notice: no more than three machines can run simultaneously in the laundry room from 3-5 PM on weekends to prevent overloading the circuits. Mia needs to do laundry urgently, so she decides to use the dryer at 3 PM on Saturday. Meanwhile, Alex, who just returned from a soccer game, starts his washing machine to clean his uniform. Zoe, who lives on the floor above, also begins drying a load of towels. Ryan, although notified that he is prohibited from using the machines on Saturday afternoons, decides to start his washing machine at the same time as the others. As the fourth machine powered on simultaneously, the electricity in the laundry room failed, halting all operations and leaving the floor without laundry access for the rest of the afternoon.",
    "query": "Did Ryan starting his washing machine at 3 PM cause the power in the laundry room to go out?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe power outage occurred because the fourth machine (Ryan's) exceeded the three-machine limit set to prevent circuit overload. Using counterfactual reasoning: if Ryan had not started his machine, only three machines would have been running, adhering to the rule and avoiding the overload. Ryan's action directly violated the limit, making it the critical difference that caused the failure. Even though others were using machines, their combined total (three) was within the safe threshold until Ryan added the fourth, establishing his action as the actual cause.",

Emma relies on her two baristas, Sarah and David, to run the front counter efficiently. They are responsible for preparing coffee orders and have the flexibility to decide how they split their tasks during their overlapping shifts. After attending a coffee exhibition, Emma was introduced to a new type of coffee bean called Premium Roast 240A, which promises a rich, full-bodied flavor. Emma decides to transition all drink preparations to this new bean to enhance the café's reputation for quality. She discusses this plan with Sarah during the shift change and tells her to make sure the new beans are used exclusively for all orders. Emma instructs Sarah to purchase several bags of Premium Roast 240A and to inform David of the change, so he can follow the same practice on his shift. Sarah immediately agrees but is distracted by a long line of customers and forgets to pass along the message to David. Over the next few weeks, a few regular customers inform Emma about an unusual sour taste in some of their coffee orders. Curious, Emma investigates by sampling multiple drinks during a random visit to her café. She finds that while some drinks taste deliciously smooth and rich, others are overtly sour, with a strong bitter aftertaste. Emma consults Sarah, who admits she neglected to inform David to use the Premium Roast 240A and suspects he has been preparing drinks using the Standard Blend 120B beans that were left over in the café. David confirms this, explaining that he had no idea about the switch and continued with the previous beans stored in the storage area. It becomes clear to Emma that the issue arose when both beans were accidentally combined in brewed coffee cups, leading to the off-tasting, sour beverages.",
    "query": "Did Sarah cause the coffee to taste sour?",
    "response": "Answer (Yes or No?): Yes  \n**Explanation**: Sarah's failure to inform David about the switch to Premium Roast 240A led to David unintentionally using the old Standard Blend 120B beans. This resulted in the accidental mixing of the two bean types, which directly caused the sour taste in some beverages. If Sarah had relayed the message as instructed, David would have used the correct beans, avoiding the issue.

The teenagers organizing the contest found themselves facing an ethical dilemma after one of them secretly obtained a list of the judge’s scoring criteria. They agreed on a plan: they would use this information to adapt their recipes and increase their likelihood of winning. However, Sarah Walker, one of the contestants and also a member of the organizing team, felt uneasy about this approach. She decided to rely solely on her original recipe, even though most of her peers had modified theirs. When the results were announced, Sarah’s cake placed 20th, allowing her to claim the last available gift card. For the 21st contestant, a skilled baker hoping to use the prize to promote her catering startup, this outcome was a disappointment as she missed the reward by a slim margin.

One Saturday, just after lunch, Sarah received an unexpected call from Mia. Eager to talk, Sarah sat down on her couch and got lost in the conversation about Mia's new life overseas, not realizing she missed the bus she intended to take to her friend's house. Her friend had asked Sarah to water her plants during a vacation, and with no alternate transportation available, Sarah phoned her younger brother, who was relaxing at home, and convinced him to step in for her. While tending to the plants, her brother accidentally stepped on a slippery patch of floor that had become wet from spilled water. The slip caused him to knock over a large decorative lamp, which hit and fractured a water pipe. The broken pipe began leaking, eventually soaking the living room floor and ruining a nearby set of electronic devices, including an expensive home theater system. Sarah's habit of lengthy, engrossing conversations was well-known to those close to her. While it was a trait that often made her seem caring and approachable, it sometimes led her to neglect time-sensitive responsibilities. Attempts to change this behavior had been largely unsuccessful, leaving her loved ones to accept it as a deeply ingrained part of her personality.",

To avoid this issue, the facility management set a schedule: Mia is instructed to use the printer exclusively in the mornings, and Liam has afternoon access only. However, despite this rule, Liam starts a print job at 10 am one day, believing he will be quick. At precisely the same moment, Mia also starts her own print job.

Determined to take advantage of the promotion, Jason immediately reactivated his subscription with MM's easy online renewal process. Finally, since the requirements were met for users with an active subscription and a rental history, Jason received his free ticket to the blockbuster premiere.",
    "query": "Did Jason get a free ticket because he reactivated his subscription?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes  \nExplanation: Jason received the free ticket because he met both promotion requirements: an active subscription (achieved by reactivating it) and a prior rental history. The reactivation was a necessary cause since his subscription had lapsed, and the promotion required a currently active subscription. Without this action, he would not have qualified for the ticket, making the reactivation a critical factor in the outcome.",

    "story": "Lisa owns a small art studio known for producing intricate paintings displayed in prominent exhibitions. She regularly works with two talented artists, Emma and Jack, assigning them the task of painting various canvases. Lisa emphasizes artistic freedom, allowing Emma and Jack to determine how to divide their workload. Both have earned her trust by producing consistent, quality work. To ensure the durability of the paintings, Lisa recently decided to apply protective varnish over completed works. After researching, she discovered that two popular varnishes, V ProGloss and V SatinShield, could offer exceptional results. However, mixing the two can lead to severe degradation of the artwork, such as cracks forming on the paint. Lisa resolved to use only V ProGloss and decided to communicate this to her artists. One morning, Lisa discussed her plan with Emma, who was busy preparing brushes at the studio. She gave Emma clear instructions: purchase V ProGloss for both herself and Jack and ensure Jack also exclusively uses it. Emma agreed, offering to save time by buying enough varnish for them both. Several weeks later, while examining the paintings in the gallery, Lisa was thrilled by a few vibrant, polished pieces but became distressed upon finding several canvases with dull, cracked surfaces. Devastated, she investigated by questioning both artists. Emma reluctantly admitted she had told Jack to use V SatinShield instead, intending to sabotage Jack’s works and make her own stand out. Although she only varnished her paintings with V ProGloss, Emma knowingly caused Jack to use the unsuitable V SatinShield. Jack, unaware of Lisa’s original instructions, explained he had used V SatinShield exclusively due to Emma’s misleading directive. Lisa realized the cracked canvases were a result of overlapping applications of both varnishes—V ProGloss and V SatinShield—on the same pieces.",
    "query": "Did the varnishing by Jack cause the paintings to crack?",
    "response": "Answer (Yes or No?): Yes  \n**Explanation**: The cracked paintings resulted from the mixture of V ProGloss and V SatinShield on the same canvases. Jack’s use of V SatinShield was a necessary component of this causal process. Without his application of V SatinShield overlapping with Emma’s V ProGloss on shared canvases, the degradation would not have occurred. Even though Emma manipulated Jack into using the incorrect varnish, his action directly contributed to the harmful mixture. Thus, Jack’s varnishing was an actual cause of the cracks.",

She relies on her experienced bakers, Emma and Charlie, to prepare the cupcake batter during busy mornings. The two bakers organize their tasks independently, and Sarah has never needed to micromanage them because of their professionalism. Wanting to introduce a new premium cupcake line for the upcoming holiday season, she decides to improve the flavor profile. After reading an article in a bakery trade journal, Sarah learns that adding high-quality vanilla extract can significantly enhance sweetness and aroma. The journal highlights two standout brands: Brand V Pure for its balanced flavor and Brand S Premium for its robust notes. However, it also strongly warns that combining extracts from different brands can create an incompatible, bitter flavor. Wanting the best results, Sarah decides to exclusively use Brand V Pure. At the next team meeting, Sarah announces her decision and tasks Emma with purchasing multiple bottles of Brand V Pure for their daily use. A few weeks later, Sarah tastes several batches of cupcakes and is surprised that some taste perfect while others are unpleasantly bitter. Confused and concerned about her new premium line, Sarah speaks separately to Emma and Charlie. Emma assures her that she followed instructions and used only the purchased Brand V Pure extract. Charlie, however, admits he still had leftover bottles of Brand S Premium extract at home, which he used to avoid waste. Sarah connects the dots and determines that the bitterness only occurs in batches where extracts from both brands were combined in the batter.",

    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\nThe use of Brand S Premium by Charlie caused the cupcakes to taste bitter **in the batches where both Brand V and Brand S were combined**. The story explicitly states that combining extracts from different brands results in bitterness, and Sarah confirmed this occurred only in batches with both brands present. While Emma followed instructions (using only Brand V), Charlie’s decision to use Brand S introduced the incompatible combination when his extract was added to the same batches as Brand V (likely due to overlapping tasks or shared batter preparation). Thus, Charlie’s action was a necessary component of the causal chain leading to the bitter taste in those specific batches.",

The biology class comprises 80 students and is graded on a curve such that 20 people will receive a grade of A, 20 a grade of B, 20 a grade of C, and 20 students will receive a D. A group of students who lived on the same floor of a dormitory obtained a copy of the final exam for their biology class. Granger's score was the 20th-highest score in the class, which means he was the last student to receive a grade of A. The 21st student was a pre-med student who received a B and, as a result, missed the GPA cutoff she needed to get into the medical school she was hoping for by .07 GPA points.",
    "query": "Did Granger cause the student to fail to meet the medical school cutoff?",
    "response": "Answer (Yes or No?): **No**\n\n**Explanation**: Granger's refusal to cheat did not cause the pre-med student to miss the cutoff. The class was graded on a strict curve, with the top 20 scores receiving an A. Granger’s honest score placed him at the 20th position, making him the last A. The pre-med student was 21st. If Granger had cheated, his score would have increased, likely moving him higher in the ranking, but the 20th spot would then be occupied by another student (likely a cheater), leaving the pre-med student still in 21st place. Thus, her position relative to the cutoff was unaffected by Granger’s decision not to cheat. Her failure to meet the cutoff resulted from her own score being lower than the top 20, not Granger’s actions.",

The oven has a strict capacity limit: it can only be used by three bakers simultaneously; otherwise, it overheats and malfunctions, disrupting the baking process. To ensure this rule is followed, James is typically scheduled to avoid using the oven on Fridays, as this is the bakery's busiest day. Clara, Ben, and Nina, on the other hand, are allowed oven access on Fridays due to the nature of their assigned tasks. Despite the rules, this Friday, James decided to use the oven at 10 AM to finish baking his cookies, believing it would only take a few minutes. Shortly after, Clara began baking her bread, Ben joined in to prepare his desserts, and Nina started making her signature pastries.

Over time, as the demand for her cakes increased significantly, she decided to hire two assistants, Emma and Jack, to manage the workload. Jack specializes in baking the cakes while Emma focuses on decorating them. They jointly discuss how to coordinate their schedules and divide responsibilities. Both employees have proven themselves to be diligent workers, which makes Lucy proud of her team. However, Lucy has been aiming to further improve the taste and presentation of her cakes to elevate the bakery’s reputation. During a pastry competition she recently attended, Lucy learned that the type of icing directly influences both the flavor and appearance of the cakes. Professional judges at the competition recommended using either Icing Mix C for its rich taste or Icing Mix D for its aesthetic shine. However, they also issued a stern warning: mixing different icing types on the same batch of cakes can completely ruin both the flavor and texture. Taking this advice seriously, Lucy decided to standardize her recipes and use only Icing Mix C for all cake decorations moving forward. A day later, while reviewing the bakery’s inventory, Lucy explained her decision to Emma. She instructed Emma to purchase an adequate stock of Icing Mix C and explicitly informed her to ensure that Jack also uses only Icing Mix C. Emma, eager to take control of the situation, assured Lucy she would handle everything. Over the next few weeks, Lucy began receiving mixed feedback from her customers—some praised her cakes for their exceptional quality, while others complained about an odd bitter aftertaste. Confused by these contradictory remarks, Lucy decided to investigate. After some persistent questioning, Emma reluctantly admitted that she had instructed Jack to use only Icing Mix D instead of Icing Mix C. Her intention was to make Jack's cakes fail so that she could have more control over cake decoration and possibly earn more recognition from Lucy. However, Emma herself followed Lucy’s instructions and used only Icing Mix C. Jack, unaware of this deception, trusted Emma's instructions and exclusively used Icing Mix D for his work. Upon analyzing the feedback and inspecting the ruined cakes, Lucy realized that they were batches that had been partially iced with Icing Mix C by Emma and Icing Mix D by Jack, causing the undesirable textures and flavors.",
    "query": "Did Jack cause the cakes to be ruined?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nJack's use of Icing Mix D was an actual cause of the cakes being ruined.

Despite knowing the rule that only bears could take pencils, the hedgehog took four pencils. If the hedgehog had not taken any, the bear would have taken fewer pencils (seven instead of eight total), leaving at least one for the polar bear.

Her dissenting stance created some friction within the team but did not alter the overall decision. After the two-month development period, their work ranked 5th—a position that secured the last award spot for bonuses and accolades from the company's executives.

One day, Sarah receives a high-profile order for a large wedding, requiring the use of intricate designs with edible glitter. Margaret, the client, explicitly requests that the glitter sparkle tastefully under the evening lights. To ensure quality, Sarah chooses a premium glitter product, G35X, known for its luster and safety. On her return to the bakery, Sarah instructs Olivia and Carter to use only G35X for the wedding cakes, emphasizing the importance of consistency in the decorations. Olivia volunteers to organize the supplies and distributes the jars among herself and Carter, intending to keep everything seamless. A week later, while reviewing the delivered photos from Margaret, Sarah is dismayed to notice some cakes shimmer beautifully, as planned, while others appear dull and streaky, as if the glitter reacted poorly with the frosting. Alarmed, Sarah immediately questions her team. Olivia confidently explains she used the gold-capped jars labeled G35X for her cakes. Carter, however, is surprised and asks Olivia, \"Gold caps? I thought G35X had blue caps like you told me! That’s why I decorated my cakes using blue-capped jars.\" Reflecting, Olivia realizes she might have confused the labels when distributing the jars. After further thought, Sarah remembers that some time ago, she had purchased another glitter, G24Z, which came in blue-capped jars, but had never used it and stored it away. Horrified, Sarah understands that Carter must have unknowingly used G24Z on some cakes, leading to inconsistent decorations. Worse still, the dull and streaky cakes were those where both G35X and G24Z had been applied together.",

On an otherwise uneventful afternoon, he invited his colleague, Dr. Harris, for a quick coffee at a newly opened, upscale cafe in downtown. Known for its exotic brews, the ambiance was lively but not distracting. As the two seated themselves and began chatting about work, Dr. Leonard's phone rang with an urgent call from his team about a patent issue. With the kind of urgency that couldn't be ignored, he left the table to find a quieter spot near the patio. Alone at the table, Dr. Harris chose this moment to retrieve a vial containing a tasteless and odorless toxin he had prepared earlier. Waiting a moment to ensure nobody was watching, he carefully poured the toxin into Dr. Leonard’s nearly empty espresso, knowing full well it would begin affecting him within an hour.

One particularly busy morning, due to an unexpected meeting with park managers, Liam unintentionally skips activating the sprinklers in a key section of the park. Mia, preoccupied with preparing a flower display before a local event, does not notice this oversight, nor does she consider tending to Liam’s area. By the end of the week, several shrubs in that section of the park exhibit signs of severe wilting.",
    "query": "Did Liam not watering the plants cause them to wilt?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation:** Liam's primary responsibility was to water the shrubs, and his failure to do so directly led to their wilting. While Mia *could* have intervened, she had no obligation to monitor or act in Liam's section. The causal chain hinges on Liam's omission (not activating sprinklers), which was both necessary and sufficient for the outcome under the park’s operational structure. Mia’s inaction, though a background condition, does not negate Liam’s role as the actual cause.",

    "story": "In a quiet suburban neighborhood, there are two families living in houses next door to each other. Both houses are equipped with motion-activated outdoor lights for added security during the evening. These lights are designed to turn on when they detect any movement within their range, whether from a person, an animal, or another moving object. The Johnson family, who live in the first house, has a habit of going jogging as a group in the evenings, usually around 6:30 pm. On the other hand, the Rivera family from the second house regularly takes their golden retriever for a walk at the same time. Today, as per their usual routine, the Johnson family began their jog promptly at 6:30 pm, and shortly after, the Rivera family started walking their dog at the exact same time. Consequently, the outdoor lights on both houses lit up simultaneously at 6:30 pm in response to the detected movements.",
    "query": "Did the family in the first house cause the lights to turn on at 6:30 pm?",
    "response": "Answer (Yes or No?): Yes  \n**Explanation**: The Johnson family’s jogging at 6:30 pm directly activated their own motion sensor, which triggered their outdoor lights to turn on. Even though the Rivera family’s actions occurred simultaneously, their motion sensor and lights are independent of the Johnsons’ system. The causal link here is direct: the Johnsons’ movement (cause) led to their lights turning on (effect). A counterfactual test confirms this: if the Johnsons had not jogged, their lights would not have activated, all else being equal. The neighbors’ actions are irrelevant to the first house’s outcome.",

    "story": "Sarah has a thriving bakery located in the heart of the city where she experiments with new recipes to attract more customers. She relies on her two assistants, James and Lisa, to prepare the essential ingredients for her creations, ensuring smooth operations in the busy kitchen. They have been working together for over a year, delegated to manage their own schedules and decide how to split their responsibilities. Sarah places great trust in them since she has rarely encountered issues with their work. One morning, Sarah reads an article in an acclaimed baking magazine about the impact of using different types of flour on bread quality. She learns that Type-A flour is highly recommended for achieving light, fluffy textures, while Type-B flour, if combined with Type-A in any batch, can result in poor consistency and doughy bread. Determined to maintain the bakery’s reputation, Sarah resolves to eliminate any possibility of mixing flours and decides that all recipes must exclusively use Type-A flour. She tells James to purchase a large supply of Type-A flour for both him and Lisa and to explicitly inform Lisa that she must use only Type-A for all her tasks. James assures her he will handle it, offering to be responsible for purchasing and passing on the instructions. Weeks later, Sarah notices troubling feedback from customers regarding inconsistent quality in some of her bread. Inspecting the batches herself, she identifies that certain loaves have excellent texture, while others are unusually dense and unappealing. Alarmed, Sarah probes the issue by speaking to James and Lisa. Eventually, James confesses that he deliberately misled Lisa by telling her that Sarah wanted only Type-B flour to be used. His intention was to sabotage Lisa's performance so she would make mistakes and ultimately be dismissed, allowing him to pick up more shifts and earn a higher wage. James, however, personally adhered to instructions and used only Type-A flour. Lisa, unaware of the deception, admits that she followed James's directions and used Type-B flour exclusively, believing that was what Sarah wanted. After piecing everything together, Sarah deduces that the inconsistent bread was caused by batches where both Type-A and Type-B flours were combined.",
    "query": "Did James cause the bread consistency to be damaged?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation:** James intentionally deceived Lisa into using Type-B flour, while he used Type-A as instructed. This created scenarios where their separate contributions to the same batches combined both flours, directly violating Sarah’s directive and causing the poor consistency. Though James adhered to using Type-A himself, his deliberate misinformation to Lisa introduced the critical causal factor (mixing flours) that damaged the bread. His actions were a necessary and sufficient condition for the outcome under the circumstances, making him an actual cause of the harm.",

The layup he made at the beginning was a sufficient condition to win $100, fulfilling the bet’s requirements on its own. Even though he later made a 3-pointer, the layup was an actual cause of his victory because it independently satisfied the bet’s terms.

Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. Tom instructs Alex and Benni to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. Alex volunteers for buying several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before.

It was known to have a rare requirement: at least one specific type of solar panel, called a Lumos panel, was needed to make it work. However, the lamp was discovered without any Lumos panels. While Jack was attending a trade fair to explore innovative gardening gadgets, he stumbled upon a booth selling spare Lumos panels and decided to buy one after some negotiation. Meanwhile, Emma, who had been looking for unrelated decorations at a gardening store, unexpectedly found a Lumos panel on sale. Seeing the opportunity, she purchased it on impulse. Later that evening, both of them excitedly brought their purchases home. They installed both Lumos panels in the lamp, even though it only required one to function. Soon after, the lamp flickered on, illuminating their garden beautifully.",

Here, the lamp requires **at least one Lumos panel** to function. Even if Emma had not purchased her Lumos panel, Jack’s panel alone would still have satisfied the lamp’s requirement and caused it to light. Since Emma’s action was not necessary for the outcome (the lamp lighting), she is not a cause under this framework.

While catching up, Dr. Langley left the table briefly to speak with the conference organizer about his upcoming presentation. In his absence, Dr. Meyer pulled out a vial containing a specialized bio-toxic compound and poured it into Dr. Langley’s coffee. This specific toxin, designed for subtlety, would take effect after an hour, though would not exhibit immediate signs for the first 30 minutes.

His primary role involves ensuring that all the plants in the park are watered regularly, which requires him to operate the automated sprinkler system each morning. Not only does he know how to manage the sprinklers, but he has also developed an efficient schedule to meet the unique needs of different plant species. Another gardener, Emma, works in the park as well, but her focus is on landscaping and designing visually appealing plant arrangements for visitors to enjoy. Even though Emma is also trained to operate the sprinkler system in case of emergencies, it is not her duty to activate it unless specifically instructed. On July 15th, a particularly hot day, Tom became distracted and forgot to turn on the sprinklers. As a result, many of the plants, especially the ones needing daily hydration, began to wilt visibly by the afternoon.",
    "query": "Did the plants wilt because Emma did not turn on the sprinklers?",
    "response": "Answer: No.\n\n**Explanation:** The primary responsibility for activating the sprinklers lies with Tom, who failed to do so on July 15th. While Emma *could* have operated the sprinklers in an emergency, her role does not obligate her to do so unless explicitly instructed. The plants wilted due to Tom’s omission, not Emma’s inaction, as her role does not establish a normative expectation for her to act in this scenario. The actual cause is Tom’s failure, not Emma’s non-intervention.",

    "story": "Tom has a huge garden and loves flowers. He employed two gardeners who take care of the plants on his 30 flower beds: Alex and Benni. Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. When Tom meets Alex in the garden shortly afterwards, he instructs him to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. He also explicitly instructs him to tell Benni to only use A X200R. Alex volunteers to buy several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself and to tell Benni about Tom's instruction. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up. That makes Tom very sad and reflective. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. After some interrogation, Alex finally confesses that he had told Benni that Tom wanted them to buy and use the chemical B Y33R instead of A X200R. He wanted Benni to use the wrong fertilizer and to get fired because he wanted to have more working hours to earn more money. He himself only used A X200R. Benni tells Tom that Alex had told him that they were only supposed to use B Y33R. He therefore only used B Y33R without knowing that Tom actually intended both gardeners to use A X200R. Tom realizes that the plants dried up in the flower beds on which both A X200R and B Y33R were applied by the gardeners.",
    "query": "Did Alex cause the plant to dry out?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes  \n**Explanation**: Alex's intentional deception of Benni directly led to Benni using B Y33R instead of the instructed A X200R. Since the plants dried up only where both fertilizers were applied (A by Alex and B by Benni), Alex's lie was a critical factor. Without his lie, Benni would have used A, avoiding the harmful mixture. Thus, Alex’s action satisfies the **but-for test** (the harm would not have occurred *but for* his lie) and is a **substantial factor** in the causal chain, making him an actual cause of the damage.",

Taylor, as usual, quickly dived into her work, focusing on her appetizer while Sam took a more measured approach prepping the ingredients for the main course. Within the first hour of cooking, Taylor impressed everyone with a perfect appetizer that looked and tasted incredible. As the evening progressed, both of them struggled to recreate such success.

The cabin relied on a special fire starter to ignite its old-fashioned stone fireplace, which was essential for heating the space. However, when they arrived at the cabin one chilly evening, Anna and Mark were disappointed to find that no fire starters had been left behind by the previous owners. Determined to solve the issue, Mark decided to visit a flea market in a nearby town the next morning. While browsing, he found a seller offering a fire starter and immediately purchased it. Meanwhile, Anna took a morning hike into the local village and stopped by an outdoor supply store. When she noticed a fire starter on display there, she thought it was a good idea to grab it, unaware of Mark’s plans. That evening, with both fire starters in their possession, they successfully lit the fireplace. Since the fireplace only needed one fire starter to function, the cabin was warmed, allowing them to enjoy a comfortable and cozy night.",
    "query": "Did Anna cause the fireplace to be lit?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nIn actual causality, the Halpern-Pearl framework often considers actions as causes if they are part of a minimal set of actual events sufficient for the outcome. Here, Anna’s purchase of a fire starter was an actual and sufficient condition for lighting the fireplace, even though Mark’s fire starter alone would also have sufficed. Since both actions independently satisfied the necessary condition (providing at least one fire starter), and both were part of the actual scenario, Anna’s action is considered a cause under this model. The counterfactual \"but-for\" test (which asks if the outcome would have occurred *but for* Anna’s action) is not the sole criterion here; instead, the focus is on whether her action was a contributing factor in the actual chain of events.

To maintain efficiency, they oversee separate sections—Ben manages the bread station, while Sarah is in charge of desserts. At the heart of the bakery is the main oven, used occasionally by both for specific tasks. Unknown to anyone, this oven has a hidden feature: if operated by two people at the same time, it automatically activates a deep-cleaning mechanism to get rid of accumulated grease. The bakery has strict rules in place to avoid disruptions: Ben is assigned to use the oven during morning prep hours, and Sarah is designated for use during the quieter late afternoon shifts. One particularly busy morning, Sarah—frustrated by a dessert baking delay—decides to use the oven at 8 am against the rule. Coincidentally, Ben is also using the oven at exactly the same time for a bread-making task. Unintentionally, their simultaneous use triggers the oven's cleaning feature, removing all the built-up grease.",

    "response": "Answer: Yes.\n\nExplanation: According to the logic of actual causality, Ben's action was a necessary component in triggering the oven's cleaning mechanism. The cleaning occurred *because* both Ben and Sarah used the oven simultaneously (a hidden requirement for the cleaning feature). If Ben had not used the oven at that time, the simultaneous activation (and thus the cleaning) would not have occurred. While Sarah violated the rules by using the oven during Ben's assigned time, this does not negate the causal role of Ben's concurrent use.

She has two skilled assistants, Sarah and Emma, who share her passion for creating delicious baked goods. Lisa recently attended a baking workshop where she learned that butter and margarine are both excellent ingredients for achieving moist cakes when used individually. However, during the workshop, the instructor emphasized that combining butter and margarine in the same batter could lead to a baking failure, such as dense and unappealing cakes. Taking this advice to heart, Lisa decides to only use butter moving forward and instructs Sarah and Emma to strictly adhere to this one-ingredient policy. To ensure things run smoothly, Sarah takes charge of purchasing all the required baking supplies and stocks the kitchen with high-quality butter. A few weeks later, Lisa notices that some of their cakes are receiving complaints from customers for being unusually flat and heavy. Alarmed, Lisa reviews the baking logs and questions her team. Sarah confirms that she followed the instruction of using only butter in every batter. However, Emma hesitantly confesses that she used a leftover supply of margarine stored at her home, wanting to avoid waste. Upon inspecting the affected recipes, Lisa uncovers that the dense cakes came from batches where both butter and margarine were unknowingly combined in the same batter, contradicting the guidelines given at the workshop.",

There are two key valves controlling water flow: the primary valve, which is programmed to open during scheduled watering periods, and the emergency override valve, which should only be used during unexpected situations to manually release water. If both valves are open at the same time, the system becomes overwhelmed, and flooding occurs. One afternoon, during maintenance work, a technician accidentally leaves the primary valve open while also testing the emergency override valve. As a result, the irrigation system overflows, causing flooding in the greenhouse.",

Both of them were deaf and worked together to advocate for better accessibility in their community. They had met years ago during a campaign for increasing street safety measures for people with disabilities and married shortly after. On a rainy evening, Lisa used an app to book a rideshare to a fundraiser downtown aimed at raising funds for local accessibility programs. As the vehicle arrived, Lisa and Mark stood at the driveway under the porch light, holding a sign with instructions due to their inability to communicate verbally with the driver. The driver, upon reading the sign and observing they might need extra assistance to load their bags and sit down, decided it would be inconvenient for him to assist them and drove away. With no other options available in their small-town area at that hour, Lisa started up her personal car, which featured visual indicators connected to the dashboard for safe driving in low visibility. Their route to the city included crossing Wyatt Bridge, a historic structure spanning the Johnson River. Unknown to them, the previous night's strong winds and heavy rainfall had caused significant damage to the bridge’s main supports. Roughly five minutes before Lisa and Mark approached, a portion of the bridge collapsed, leaving an open gap concealed by the dim streetlights. Earlier that evening, the rideshare driver had crossed the bridge without incident, just before the collapse occurred. Lisa and Mark, unaware of the situation, drove off the collapsed section of the bridge, plunging into the rushing river below.

    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation**: The rideshare driver's refusal directly led Lisa and Mark to use their own car, which resulted in them arriving at Wyatt Bridge **after** its collapse. If the driver had taken them, they would have departed earlier (immediately after the driver arrived) and likely crossed the bridge **before** it collapsed, as the driver had safely crossed it earlier that evening.

The platform has indicator lights to ensure only one crane crosses at a time. Unbeknownst to Alex and Jamie, the storm has weakened the platform's supports to a critical point. Alex's light flashes green, prompting him to move immediately onto the platform. At the same time, Jamie's light also turns green, signaling her to proceed. Both, trusting the system, drive their cranes onto the platform simultaneously. The combined weight is too much for the fragile structure. Amid the loud creaking of steel, the platform collapses into the pit below.",

Here, the platform collapsed due to the combined weight of both cranes. While the storm weakened the platform, the critical factor was the simultaneous presence of both cranes. If Alex had not entered the platform, the collapse might still have occurred if Jamie alone exceeded the weakened structure’s capacity. However, the story explicitly states the collapse resulted from the **combined weight** of both cranes, implying neither crane alone would have been sufficient.

Some competitors envied his breakthroughs and saw him as an obstacle to their own ambitions. During a professional luncheon at an upscale research conference, Dr. Reid attended a private meeting with Dr. Calloway, a close collaborator on one of his projects. At one point, Dr. Reid stepped away to discuss an urgent call with conference organizers about an upcoming keynote speech he was scheduled to give. Seizing the opportunity, Dr. Calloway, under pressure from rival interests, surreptitiously spiked Dr. Reid's glass of mineral water with a colorless, lethal compound sourced from the lab. This compound had a delayed onset time, with symptoms typically appearing 30 minutes later and total fatality within one hour, depending on body chemistry. Unaware, Dr. Reid came back, finished his water, and the conversation with Dr. Calloway ended cordially. Shortly after paying for the meal, Dr. Reid began his drive to a secluded off-site lab where he was overseeing a critical experiment. On the drive through a lonely stretch of forest road, a large delivery truck suddenly pulled out from a hidden gravel side path and began shadowing his vehicle.

Mia and Liam, her two assistants, help her with various tasks, from baking to decorating. Emma recently attended a baking workshop and learned from an expert that using premium flavor enhancers like PremiumVanilla Extract Z1 or ChocolateBoost Concentrate C2 can elevate desserts significantly. However, she also learned that mixing these enhancers in the same recipe can lead to an overpowering and unpleasant taste. Back at the bakery, Emma decides to stick exclusively to PremiumVanilla Extract Z1 and informs Mia and Liam about the plan. She also asks Mia to purchase several bottles of PremiumVanilla Extract Z1 to ensure they have enough supply. Days later, while sampling her desserts, Emma is thrilled to find that some have a richer, more delightful flavor than before. However, she nearly spits out one batch of cookies, which taste bitter instead of sweet. Emma's curiosity turns to concern, and she approaches Mia and Liam to investigate. Mia confidently states, \"I funneled PremiumVanilla Extract Z1 into the yellow bottle and have been using it solely in recipes.\" Liam, on the other hand, looks puzzled: \"But I always used the blue bottle. Mia, you said you'd filled PremiumVanilla Extract Z1 in the blue bottle, didn’t you?\" Mia pauses and replies sheepishly, \"Oh no, I might have made a mistake.

The stock manager quickly checks the inventory and confirms that enough is in stock, providing the necessary approval. Then, the sous-chef seeks permission from the head chef, whose role is to ensure creative decisions stay aligned with the restaurant's established standards. The head chef immediately identifies a problem: the restaurant policy explicitly discourages the use of alternative seasonings in traditional signature dishes, as it risks upsetting loyal patrons. Despite recognizing the policy, the head chef decides to allow it this time, trusting the sous-chef's instincts. With approval from both parties, the rare seasoning blend is added to the dish.

Emma recently attended a baking workshop and learned from an expert that using premium flavor enhancers like PremiumVanilla Extract Z1 or ChocolateBoost Concentrate C2 can elevate desserts significantly. However, she also learned that mixing these enhancers in the same recipe can lead to an overpowering and unpleasant taste.

    "story": "A high school student is tasked with organizing a charity basketball game to fundraise for new athletic equipment. The game venue, the school’s main gym, is a sought-after space that requires special approval for use. Knowing this, the student submits a request that needs sign-offs from both the school principal and the athletic director. The principal, aware of an internal guideline to limit gym use for outside events to conserve facility costs, chooses to approve the request due to the fundraiser's purpose. Meanwhile, the athletic director, after verifying there are no scheduling conflicts with sports practices, confirms the request immediately. With these approvals, the gym gets reserved, and the game becomes a major success, drawing wide community support and raising substantial funds.",
    "query": "Did the principal's approval cause the event's success?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe principal's approval was a necessary cause of the event's success. Both approvals (principal and athletic director) were required to reserve the gym. In a counterfactual scenario where the principal had denied approval, the gym reservation would not have occurred, preventing the event. While the athletic director's approval was also necessary, the principal’s decision directly enabled the use of the gym despite internal guidelines, making it a critical contributing factor to the outcome. Thus, the principal's approval satisfies the criteria for actual causality.",

Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 11 or the spinner lands on green. It is very unlikely that he will roll higher than 11. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so amazingly, he rolled greater than 11, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game.",

    "response": "Answer: No.\n\n**Explanation**:  \nAlex's win required either a dice total >11 **or** the spinner landing on green. Both conditions occurred, but the dice roll alone (12) was sufficient to guarantee victory. Using the counterfactual test: If the spinner had **not** landed on green, Alex still would have won due to the dice roll.

Her two assistants, Mia and Ethan, are skilled in different aspects of baking, with Mia specializing in decoration and Ethan focusing on cake bases. Sarah recently attended a professional baking workshop, where a renowned chef emphasized that the right frosting can elevate cakes to a whole new level. Inspired, Sarah decides to adopt a specific frosting, Frosting A, which she believes will give her cakes a competitive edge. However, she also learns that mixing different types of frosting can ruin the taste and presentation of cakes. Determined to avoid this pitfall, Sarah privately explains her decision to Mia, emphasizing the need to use only Frosting A on all cakes moving forward. She relies on Mia to communicate this rule to Ethan, as Sarah leaves the bakery to attend additional workshops. Mia assures Sarah that she will handle everything, including purchasing Frosting A for both of them. Weeks later, Sarah returns and begins receiving mixed feedback from her customers. While some rave about the improvements in the cakes, others complain about bitter-tasting, poorly presented cakes. Concerned, Sarah inspects the leftover frostings in the bakery's storage. During her conversation with her assistants, Mia admits she completely forgot to inform Ethan about the new policy. Mia had been using Frosting A as instructed, but Ethan confesses he continued using the previously stored Frosting B, which was kept in a blue container. Realizing the problem, Sarah concludes that both Frostings A and B must have been applied to certain cakes by mistake, which caused those cakes to turn out poorly. Devastated by the ruined reputation of some of her cakes, Sarah resolves to reinforce better communication in her team to prevent such mishaps in the future.",
    "query": "Did Ethan cause the cakes to be ruined?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation:** Ethan's use of Frosting B directly contributed to the ruined cakes. While Mia failed to inform him of the new policy, Ethan's action of using Frosting B (which, when mixed with Frosting A, caused the negative outcome) was a necessary component of the causal chain. Without his use of Frosting B, the incompatible combination would not have occurred, even if Mia had neglected her duty. Thus, Ethan's action is a proximate and actual cause of the ruined cakes.",

To meet the increasing demand, she relies on two assistants, Emily and Jacob, who share the responsibilities of preparing the cake batters and managing ingredients. Knowing that the flavor of her cakes can be further refined, Sophia decides to use syrup Q503F, a premium enhancer praised by experts. However, she specifically instructs that the old syrup, P20K, should no longer be used in any recipes. Sophia also asks Emily to buy Q503F and ensure it is stored properly. Later, a loyal customer mentions that some recent cakes taste odd and unlike the usual recipe. Alarmed by this feedback, Sophia samples several cakes and confirms the strange flavor in some batches. She immediately confronts her assistants. Emily explains that she had stored the Q503F in the shop's red container after purchasing it, as instructed. Jacob, surprised, says that he had used the syrup from the blue container because Emily had told him that Q503F was there. Emily looks worried and admits: \"Oh no, I might have confused the container colors. That was a mistake on my part.\" Sophia recalls that the blue container held the previously used syrup, P20K. After carefully reviewing their workflow, Sophia concludes that the odd-tasting cakes came from batches where both Q503F and P20K were mixed, something she had specifically avoided in her instructions.",

While Emily's miscommunication about the container's color contributed to the error, Jacob's choice to use the blue container (which he believed contained Q503F but actually held P20K) was a necessary and actual cause of the odd flavor.

She used it to maintain the backyard garden she was proud of, particularly her neat rows of flowers and carefully trimmed hedges. Her brother Tom, who was passionate about engine mechanics, often borrowed the lawnmower to tinker with it in the garage, despite Ellen's repeated warnings: \"Tom, if this lawnmower is running too long at the same time as I'm using it, it could overheat and break.\" On Sunday afternoon, while Ellen was mowing around the flowerbeds to prepare for a backyard barbecue, Tom ran the lawnmower in the garage to test engine adjustments he had made earlier. By evening, the lawnmower suddenly overheated and stopped working entirely. Later, as Ellen's father explained the situation to the repairman, the repairman examined the overheated engine and remarked, \"I see that Tom was using the lawnmower, but that alone wouldn't have caused it to break.

They have been working together for over a year, delegated to manage their own schedules and decide how to split their responsibilities. Sarah places great trust in them since she has rarely encountered issues with their work. One morning, Sarah reads an article in an acclaimed baking magazine about the impact of using different types of flour on bread quality. She learns that Type-A flour is highly recommended for achieving light, fluffy textures, while Type-B flour, if combined with Type-A in any batch, can result in poor consistency and doughy bread. Determined to maintain the bakery’s reputation, Sarah resolves to eliminate any possibility of mixing flours and decides that all recipes must exclusively use Type-A flour.

James assures her he will handle it, offering to be responsible for purchasing and passing on the instructions. Weeks later, Sarah notices troubling feedback from customers regarding inconsistent quality in some of her bread.

While grabbing her usual morning coffee at a nearby cafe, she spontaneously struck up a long conversation with a former colleague she hadn’t seen in years. This casual reunion caused Emma to lose track of time. Realizing she was running late, Emma entrusted her assistant, who was stationed in the office, to rush the key presentation materials to the meeting venue. The assistant, however, was struck by a reckless speeding motorist while en route. Fortunately, they escaped serious injury, but the presentation materials were not as lucky—they were completely destroyed in the crash. Emma’s colleagues often joked about her habit of losing herself in conversations, a trait that occasionally led to minor delays at work. Despite being aware of it, Emma found it challenging to rein in her social tendencies, especially in moments of spontaneity.",

    "response": "Answer: No. \n\n**Explanation:** While Emma's delay set the chain of events in motion, the direct and superseding cause of the loss was the reckless motorist's actions. The motorist’s behavior constitutes an unforeseeable, intervening cause that breaks the causal chain from Emma’s initial act. Legal and philosophical frameworks of actual causality typically treat such independent, external events as the primary cause, absolving earlier links (like Emma’s delay) of direct responsibility.

Cyclists, however, were prohibited from using this spot for parking since their vehicles were expected to be left in designated bike racks nearby. A city hall meeting had publicized this new rule, but the cyclist, who rarely attended such events, was unaware of it. On a hectic afternoon, the parking space was occupied alternately, first by the delivery driver stopping briefly to unload packages and then by a cyclist who parked their bike despite the prohibition. This pattern repeated several times throughout the afternoon. Eventually, both the delivery driver and the cyclist returned at the same time and simultaneously used the parking space, leaving it completely occupied.

Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off.

    "response": "Answer: **Yes**\n\n**Explanation**: Lucas's action was a necessary component in causing the irrigation system's malfunction. The system failed due to simultaneous overuse, which required both Lucas and Emma watering at the same time. While Lucas followed the schedule, his watering (combined with Emma's deviation from the plan) created the overload. In a counterfactual scenario where Lucas did not water at 8:30 am, the system likely would not have malfunctioned (assuming Emma alone at that time did not exceed its capacity).

Lisa recently attended a culinary workshop, where a chef recommended a unique sugar substitute named SweetX for healthier and tastier desserts. The chef issued a warning: blending this substitute with others could ruin the flavors. Inspired, Lisa decides to adopt SweetX as the exclusive sugar substitute for her bakery. Lisa places an order for SweetX and, the next day, speaks to Sarah who arrives early to set up the kitchen. She explains the decision and instructs Sarah to only use SweetX in recipes from now on. Lisa also asks Sarah, who often communicates with Mike about daily responsibilities, to inform Mike of the new rule. Sarah agrees to handle it and also volunteers to stock the kitchen immediately. Over the following weeks, Lisa notices mixed feedback from customers. Curious, she samples the cakes herself. While some cakes are extraordinary, others have a bitter taste and unpleasant consistency. Concerned about what went wrong, Lisa holds a meeting with Sarah and Mike. At the meeting, Sarah admits to forgetting to inform Mike about the SweetX policy. Sarah clarifies that she herself exclusively used SweetX in her baking, but Mike reveals he continued using SugarZ, the sugar substitute they had used previously, as he hadn’t been told of any changes. Lisa remembers that SugarZ was stored in bright red-labeled jars in the pantry. Concluding from their discussion, Lisa determines that the bitter cakes resulted from batches where SweetX and SugarZ were accidentally combined.",

    "response": "Answer: Yes.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe bitter cakes occurred due to the combination of SweetX and SugarZ. Mike's continued use of SugarZ (because he wasn't informed of the new policy) directly contributed to this unintended blending. While SugarZ alone might not have caused bitterness, its use alongside SweetX violated the chef's warning and created the flawed batches. Thus, SugarZ is a causal factor in the bitter outcome under the actual circumstances (its presence was necessary for the negative effect in the mixed batches).",

Recently, after attending a workshop on workplace wellness, Lisa wanted to ensure the cleaning products used are both effective and safe. Based on recommendations from the workshop, she decided to switch to a cleaning spray called S P300C, known for neutralizing bacteria and leaving a refreshing citrus scent. Lisa also learned that mixing different cleaning sprays in the same area could release irritants harmful to health. Eager to implement the change, Lisa encounters Emma one evening as she finishes her shift. Lisa discusses the benefits of S P300C with Emma and stresses that only this product should be used going forward. Furthermore, Lisa asks Emma to pass on these instructions to Michael, as Lisa wouldn’t see him before his next shift. Emma agrees and even offers to stock enough bottles of S P300C in the storage cabinet for both herself and Michael. Weeks later, Lisa begins noticing an inconsistency in the coworking space.

On a particular morning, Mark began reheating bread as planned at 9:00 am. Yet, Ethan disregarded their agreement and used the oven simultaneously, attempting to bake a cake. Predictably, the oven malfunctioned instantly and stopped working.",
    "query": "Did Ethan cause the oven to break down?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation**: The oven breaks down specifically when two people operate it simultaneously. Ethan violated the agreed schedule by using the oven at the same time as Mark, creating the condition (simultaneous use) directly responsible for the malfunction. A counterfactual test confirms this: if Ethan had not acted, the oven would not have broken. Thus, Ethan's action is the critical difference-maker in the causal outcome.",

One day, they approach a fragile section of the factory roof from different sides at the same moment. Maria notices a faded warning sign that says 'Keep Off: Unstable Roof,' but she decides to ignore it, thinking the warning must be outdated. Jake, however, sees no such sign on his side, as it has fallen off over time, and proceeds to walk onto the roof section without hesitation. What neither of them knows is that the roof section is incapable of supporting the combined weight of two people at once. If only one of them had stepped on it, the section would have held steady. As Maria steps onto the roof at the same time as Jake, the old beams beneath them strain under the weight, and the roof collapses instantly.",
    "query": "Did Jake cause the roof to collapse?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation**: Both Maria and Jake stepping onto the roof simultaneously were necessary and sufficient conditions for the collapse (since the roof could not support two people). Under standard accounts of actual causation (e.g., counterfactual dependence or structural equations), Jake’s action was a cause because the collapse would not have occurred *in the actual circumstances* if he had not stepped onto the roof (even though Maria’s action was also necessary).

The first deck, mostly red, makes a red card an expected pick, while the second deck has very few black cards, making that draw exceedingly rare.

Wanting to introduce a new premium cupcake line for the upcoming holiday season, she decides to improve the flavor profile. After reading an article in a bakery trade journal, Sarah learns that adding high-quality vanilla extract can significantly enhance sweetness and aroma. The journal highlights two standout brands: Brand V Pure for its balanced flavor and Brand S Premium for its robust notes. However, it also strongly warns that combining extracts from different brands can create an incompatible, bitter flavor. Wanting the best results, Sarah decides to exclusively use Brand V Pure.

Emma’s use of Brand V Pure alone did not cause bitterness—it was the *combination* of both brands that led to the undesirable outcome. Since the bitterness required Charlie’s unauthorized use of Brand S Premium alongside Emma’s Brand V Pure, Emma’s action (using Brand V Pure as instructed) was not the standalone cause of the bitterness.

Emma relies on her two baristas, Sarah and David, to run the front counter efficiently. They are responsible for preparing coffee orders and have the flexibility to decide how they split their tasks during their overlapping shifts. After attending a coffee exhibition, Emma was introduced to a new type of coffee bean called Premium Roast 240A, which promises a rich, full-bodied flavor. Emma decides to transition all drink preparations to this new bean to enhance the café's reputation for quality. She discusses this plan with Sarah during the shift change and tells her to make sure the new beans are used exclusively for all orders. Emma instructs Sarah to purchase several bags of Premium Roast 240A and to inform David of the change, so he can follow the same practice on his shift. Sarah immediately agrees but is distracted by a long line of customers and forgets to pass along the message to David. Over the next few weeks, a few regular customers inform Emma about an unusual sour taste in some of their coffee orders. Curious, Emma investigates by sampling multiple drinks during a random visit to her café. She finds that while some drinks taste deliciously smooth and rich, others are overtly sour, with a strong bitter aftertaste. Emma consults Sarah, who admits she neglected to inform David to use the Premium Roast 240A and suspects he has been preparing drinks using the Standard Blend 120B beans that were left over in the café.

He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him.

    "response": "Answer (Yes or No?): Yes\n\n**Explanation:**  \nSam's use of CaféBlend beans directly contributed to the bitterness in the coffee. The workshop warned that **blending different bean brands** causes bitterness. While Rachel used RoastPure, Sam continued using CaféBlend due to Rachel’s failure to inform him. This resulted in scenarios where both bean types were inadvertently mixed during preparation (e.g., cross-contamination in shared equipment or sequential use without cleaning). Since the bitterness arose specifically from the **blend of RoastPure and CaféBlend**, Sam’s actions (using CaféBlend) were a necessary part of the causal chain. Without his use of the old beans, the harmful blending would not have occurred, making his role a cause of the bitterness.",

Concerned about the safety of the frantic animal and others on the road, she pulled over and spent several minutes trying to coax the dog to safety. This delayed her arrival at work, and by the time she reached her building, an important client pitch had begun without her. Her co-worker Amanda, noticing Rachel's absence, stepped in to present Rachel's slides based on brief notes Rachel had shared with her the previous day. Though well-intentioned, Amanda accidentally misinterpreted key numbers during the presentation, leading to a significant miscommunication with the client. Ultimately, the deal was lost, costing their team a vital opportunity. Rachel's actions stemmed from her compassionate nature. Her colleagues often remark that she has an unwavering commitment to helping others, even when it comes at a personal or professional cost.",
    "query": "Did Rachel cause the company to lose the contract?",

This absence necessitated Amanda's intervention, which resulted in the critical misinterpretation of data. Using counterfactual reasoning: *Had Rachel not stopped*, she would have presented her own slides, likely avoiding the error. While Amanda’s mistake was the proximate cause, Rachel’s action set this chain in motion, making it an actual cause under standard causal frameworks (e.g., necessity and dependency in the causal chain).

It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2, and the coin has equal odds of coming up heads or tails. Alex flips the coin and rolls his dice at exactly the same time.

There are two groups of joggers who regularly use this track: a fitness club that prefers to start jogging at precisely 5:30 am, and a group of friends who typically enjoy slower-paced jogging at 6:00 am. Each group alone generates enough activity to trigger the motion sensor lights upon their arrival. This morning, the fitness club began their usual jog right on schedule at 5:30 am. Unusually, the group of friends also decided to meet earlier than usual at 5:30 am to enjoy a rare sunrise together. This coincidence caused the motion sensor lighting system to activate at 5:30 am.",
    "query": "Did the second group of joggers cause the motion sensor lights to activate at 5:30 am?",

Here, the second group of joggers (the friends) arrived at 5:30 am, and their presence alone was sufficient to activate the lights. While the fitness club’s presence would have also triggered the lights independently, the friends’ contribution was part of the actual scenario that led to the activation at 5:30 am. In causal frameworks like the NESS test (Necessary Element of a Sufficient Set), the friends qualify as a cause because their presence was a sufficient condition for the outcome, even though their absence would not have prevented it.

Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. Tom instructs Alex and Benni to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. Alex volunteers for buying several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up. That makes Tom very sad and reflective. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. Alex tells him that he followed Tom's instruction: \"I only bought and used the chemical A X200R which I had funneled into the blue can.\" Benni suddenly is startled and says to Alex: \"What?

Although their roles are well-defined, Maria allows Jessica and Liam some flexibility in deciding how to split their daily tasks. Looking to innovate her menu, Maria decides to introduce a premium chocolate ganache using chocolate type C Z100, which she believes will elevate the flavor of desserts. She specifically tells Jessica to use only C Z100 for all ganache preparations and asks her to ensure Liam follows the same instructions. Jessica agrees but has hidden motives—she wants to outshine Liam and aims to make him look incompetent in front of Maria. Instead of passing on the correct instructions, Jessica falsely informs Liam that Maria preferred him to use a cheaper and less compatible chocolate, D Q45. While Jessica uses only C Z100 in her assigned recipes, Liam unknowingly uses D Q45 for his tasks, trusting Jessica's guidance. After a few weeks, Maria notices that some desserts have a luxurious taste reminiscent of her vision, but others have an odd bitterness that disappoints her customers.

She has access to two bowls: one brimming with colorful vegetables grown from different continents, and another packed with a variety of premium spices. The rules are strict: her recipe will only be considered for victory if she incorporates a red pepper from the vegetable bowl and a rare spice blend that is tucked amidst the spices. Statistically, she is likely to grab a red pepper from the vegetable bowl, as there are fewer options there. However, the rare spice blend is extremely hard to find in the mix, as most spices in the bowl look nearly identical. Trusting her instincts, she carefully selects a red pepper from the vegetable bowl and then takes her chance with the spice bowl. Miraculously, she grabs the rare spice blend, completing the requirements. The judges take a bite and announce Sarah as the winner for this session.",

    "story": "Dr. Bennett works as a veterinarian specializing in exotic animals at one of the largest animal hospitals in the city. Recently, she identified the pressing need for a state-of-the-art ultrasound machine to help diagnose her patients more effectively. Within her hospital, any purchase exceeding a certain budget threshold requires approval from two decision-making groups: the equipment procurement committee and the financial oversight board. These groups function independently, with neither being required to consult the other during deliberations. Approval from just one of these groups is enough to authorize the requested purchase. The equipment procurement committee has a reputation for being supportive of such requests and generally has a high approval rate. On the other hand, the financial oversight board takes a much stricter approach, often rejecting proposals regardless of their merit, given their focus on keeping expenditures to a minimum. Despite knowing this, Dr. Bennett submits her request to both groups. On the set date when both groups hold their respective meetings, the equipment procurement committee makes the expected decision to approve her request. To her surprise, the financial oversight board also gives its approval, a rare occurrence. As a result, Dr. Bennett is granted permission to purchase the ultrasound machine, significantly benefiting her patients.",

Each committee's approval alone was sufficient for the outcome, and both approvals occurred in the actual sequence of events. While the FOB's approval was unexpected, the EPC's approval still qualifies as a cause because it independently satisfied the sufficient condition for the outcome.

To handle the growing demand during the holiday season, she recently hired Jessica and Liam as assistant bakers. Maria emphasizes her love for consistent quality and assigns Jessica to oversee the chocolate-based recipes. Although their roles are well-defined, Maria allows Jessica and Liam some flexibility in deciding how to split their daily tasks. Looking to innovate her menu, Maria decides to introduce a premium chocolate ganache using chocolate type C Z100, which she believes will elevate the flavor of desserts. She specifically tells Jessica to use only C Z100 for all ganache preparations and asks her to ensure Liam follows the same instructions. Jessica agrees but has hidden motives—she wants to outshine Liam and aims to make him look incompetent in front of Maria. Instead of passing on the correct instructions, Jessica falsely informs Liam that Maria preferred him to use a cheaper and less compatible chocolate, D Q45. While Jessica uses only C Z100 in her assigned recipes, Liam unknowingly uses D Q45 for his tasks, trusting Jessica's guidance. After a few weeks, Maria notices that some desserts have a luxurious taste reminiscent of her vision, but others have an odd bitterness that disappoints her customers. Maria investigates and discovers the truth: desserts made with a mixture of C Z100 and D Q45 developed an unpleasant bitter flavor due to an unforeseen reaction between the two chocolate types. Jessica admits to her scheme of giving Liam the wrong instructions, leaving Maria deeply frustrated over the sabotage of her bakery's reputation.",

Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R.

    "story": "In a small coastal town, Sarah was organizing a much-anticipated village pie festival. She had recruited two enthusiastic assistants, Jake and Emma, to help with pre-festival preparations. Sarah stressed the importance of using only high-quality ingredients she had provided and making sure any storage containers were labeled correctly. As the festival emphasized perfect pie crusts, Sarah ordered two specialty flours: SuperFine 101A, known for its velvety smoothness, and HighRise 202B, ideal for fluffy textures. However, in her research, she discovered that combining these two particular flours often led to disastrous results like sunken or gummy pies. To avoid this, Sarah made it clear that they should exclusively use SuperFine 101A. Jake agreed to portion out the flour and ensure everything was ready for Emma and himself. After the frenzy of preparation, the festival commenced, but soon some pies were found to have collapsed with strange, uneven textures. Alarmed, Sarah began investigating. Emma mentioned that she had been relying on instructions from Jake and had used the flour stored in a white container. Jake suddenly realized and admitted, \"Oh no! I told you the wrong container — SuperFine 101A is in the silver container. I didn’t check properly when I gave you that information.\" Emma then explained that, earlier that morning, she had also spotted HighRise 202B in the white container, completely unlabeled. Jake’s face fell as he admitted, \"That’s on me! I should’ve double-checked all the containers.\" Sarah concluded that some pies collapsed because recipes ended up using both SuperFine 101A and HighRise 202B as a result of Jake's mistake.",
    "query": "Did Jake cause the baked goods to collapse?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes  \n**Explanation**: Jake's actions were a critical factor in the pies collapsing. He incorrectly informed Emma that SuperFine 101A was in the white container (when it was actually in silver) and failed to label the white container holding HighRise 202B. This led to the inadvertent combination of both flours, which Sarah had explicitly warned would cause structural failures. While Emma followed Jake’s instructions, the root cause of the error—mislabeling and misinformation—traces back to Jake’s negligence. Thus, his mistakes directly enabled the causal chain resulting in the collapsed pies.",

The condition severely affected his ability to detoxify certain food additives, particularly the synthetic chemicals widely used in processed foods. One evening, after the successful delivery of a crucial project, Liam’s manager, Ms. Rivera, arranged a celebratory dinner at a high-end steakhouse known for its bold marinades. Feeling confident as a regular guest at the restaurant, Ms. Rivera decided to surprise Liam by ordering his meal. She had initially leaned towards selecting the Cajun Prime Rib because of its hearty reputation. Ultimately, she opted for the Teriyaki Steak, thinking it might suit the celebratory mood better. Ms. Rivera, however, was unaware that both dishes relied on marinades containing artificial additives, known triggers for Liam’s condition. After savoring the rich meal, Liam began to experience sharp discomfort. Within minutes, his situation escalated drastically, and he collapsed before being rushed to the hospital. Tragically, Liam could not make it through the ambulance ride.",

While the Cajun Prime Rib also contained additives, her *specific action* of selecting a dish with additives (regardless of which one) was a necessary element in the causal chain. Under the **NESS test** (Necessary Element of a Sufficient Set), her decision was part of the actual sufficient conditions for the outcome.

Despite this, on one particularly hectic Friday evening at 6 PM, Alex, trying to save time, starts heating a pan on one burner. Simultaneously, Mia, preoccupied with preparing soup for a customer, begins boiling water on another burner. A third burner is then lit by Liam, who is frying a batch of vegetables for an incoming order.

She regularly works with two talented artists, Emma and Jack, assigning them the task of painting various canvases. Lisa emphasizes artistic freedom, allowing Emma and Jack to determine how to divide their workload. Both have earned her trust by producing consistent, quality work. To ensure the durability of the paintings, Lisa recently decided to apply protective varnish over completed works. After researching, she discovered that two popular varnishes, V ProGloss and V SatinShield, could offer exceptional results. However, mixing the two can lead to severe degradation of the artwork, such as cracks forming on the paint. Lisa resolved to use only V ProGloss and decided to communicate this to her artists. One morning, Lisa discussed her plan with Emma, who was busy preparing brushes at the studio. She gave Emma clear instructions: purchase V ProGloss for both herself and Jack and ensure Jack also exclusively uses it. Emma agreed, offering to save time by buying enough varnish for them both. Several weeks later, while examining the paintings in the gallery, Lisa was thrilled by a few vibrant, polished pieces but became distressed upon finding several canvases with dull, cracked surfaces. Devastated, she investigated by questioning both artists. Emma reluctantly admitted she had told Jack to use V SatinShield instead, intending to sabotage Jack’s works and make her own stand out. Although she only varnished her paintings with V ProGloss, Emma knowingly caused Jack to use the unsuitable V SatinShield. Jack, unaware of Lisa’s original instructions, explained he had used V SatinShield exclusively due to Emma’s misleading directive. Lisa realized the cracked canvases were a result of overlapping applications of both varnishes—V ProGloss and V SatinShield—on the same pieces.",

One day, Sarah receives a high-profile order for a large wedding, requiring the use of intricate designs with edible glitter. Margaret, the client, explicitly requests that the glitter sparkle tastefully under the evening lights. To ensure quality, Sarah chooses a premium glitter product, G35X, known for its luster and safety. On her return to the bakery, Sarah instructs Olivia and Carter to use only G35X for the wedding cakes, emphasizing the importance of consistency in the decorations. Olivia volunteers to organize the supplies and distributes the jars among herself and Carter, intending to keep everything seamless. A week later, while reviewing the delivered photos from Margaret, Sarah is dismayed to notice some cakes shimmer beautifully, as planned, while others appear dull and streaky, as if the glitter reacted poorly with the frosting. Alarmed, Sarah immediately questions her team. Olivia confidently explains she used the gold-capped jars labeled G35X for her cakes. Carter, however, is surprised and asks Olivia, \"Gold caps? I thought G35X had blue caps like you told me! That’s why I decorated my cakes using blue-capped jars.\" Reflecting, Olivia realizes she might have confused the labels when distributing the jars. After further thought, Sarah remembers that some time ago, she had purchased another glitter, G24Z, which came in blue-capped jars, but had never used it and stored it away.

Rachel admits during a meeting, \"I completely forgot to tell Sam about the change! I've been using RoastPure exclusively, but I think Sam kept using the old CaféBlend beans.\" Sam later confirms, explaining, \"I didn’t know about any change, so I’ve just been using the coffee beans in the usual yellow-labeled container.\" Lisa realizes the problem: Rachel had forgotten to provide the new beans or warn Sam, leading him to continue using CaféBlend. This mix of coffees from two different bean types during preparation had resulted in the inconsistent flavors and the bitter cups some customers reported.",
    "query": "Did the coffee preparation by Rachel cause the coffee to taste bitter?",
    "response": "Answer: No. \n\n**Explanation**: Rachel's coffee preparation involved using only RoastPure beans as instructed, which did not directly cause bitterness. The bitterness arose when Sam, unaware of the new policy due to Rachel's failure to inform him, used CaféBlend beans. The blending of RoastPure (used by Rachel) and CaféBlend (used by Sam) during preparation across shifts caused the bitterness. Rachel’s *omission* (not informing Sam) contributed to the problem, but her own coffee-making actions (using RoastPure alone) did not directly result in bitter coffee.",

    "story": "Dr. Allen is a senior surgeon at a well-known hospital. The hospital management has established a strict protocol for approving requests for new medical equipment. To proceed, doctors must undergo reviews from two separate committees: the technology panel, which assesses the equipment's technical suitability, and the finance panel, which evaluates its cost-effectiveness. Dr. Allen has been advocating for advanced surgical tools to improve patient care. She submits her application, knowing that the technology panel is usually lenient and recommends nearly all requests. However, the finance panel is infamous for its rigorous scrutiny, frequently rejecting applications due to budget concerns. The two committees work independently and make their decisions during scheduled weekly meetings. Surprisingly, on the day of the review, both the technology panel and the finance panel approve Dr. Allen's request. Thanks to this rare outcome, Dr. Allen successfully receives the new surgical tools, marking a significant milestone for the hospital's surgical department.",
    "query": "Does the technology panel cause the approval of Dr. Allen's request?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe approval of Dr. Allen's request required **both** the technology panel and finance panel to approve. While the technology panel is typically lenient, its approval was still a necessary condition for the outcome. In counterfactual terms, if the technology panel had *not* approved (even if the finance panel did), the request would have been rejected. Thus, both panels are actual causes because each constitutes a necessary part of the minimally sufficient set of conditions for the approval.

The rules of this round require participants to pick two cards randomly from a deck of numbered cards (ranging from 1 to 6) and spin a multi-colored wheel featuring sections like red, blue, and green. To progress to the finals, Chris needs either the sum of their numbers to exceed 2 or for the wheel to stop on red—conditions that are considered very achievable. Confidently, they proceed to draw and spin. Their cards show a sum of 12, far surpassing 2, while the wheel also conveniently lands on the red section. With such favorable outcomes, Chris secures their place in the final round.",

The card sum (12) alone sufficed to guarantee victory, making the wheel's red result **unnecessary** for the outcome.

The coworking space is divided into 15 sections, and Emma and Michael have agreed to split the workload evenly, coordinating their shifts as needed. Lisa is pleased with their performance. Recently, after attending a workshop on workplace wellness, Lisa wanted to ensure the cleaning products used are both effective and safe. Based on recommendations from the workshop, she decided to switch to a cleaning spray called S P300C, known for neutralizing bacteria and leaving a refreshing citrus scent. Lisa also learned that mixing different cleaning sprays in the same area could release irritants harmful to health. Eager to implement the change, Lisa encounters Emma one evening as she finishes her shift. Lisa discusses the benefits of S P300C with Emma and stresses that only this product should be used going forward. Furthermore, Lisa asks Emma to pass on these instructions to Michael, as Lisa wouldn’t see him before his next shift. Emma agrees and even offers to stock enough bottles of S P300C in the storage cabinet for both herself and Michael. Weeks later, Lisa begins noticing an inconsistency in the coworking space. Some sections smell rejuvenated and spotless, while others emit a strange chemical odor. Worse, several employees have reported mild irritation, such as watery eyes and headaches. Alarmed, Lisa gathers Emma and Michael for a discussion. Emma quickly confesses that she accidentally forgot to convey the new rule to Michael. While Emma only used S P300C, Michael explains that he continued using the spray called L Q200T, stored in a plain bottle in the cabinet. It turns out that L Q200T was an older multi-purpose cleaner Michael had relied on previously. After further evaluation, Lisa realizes the problems occurred in sections where sprays S P300C and L Q200T had been used together, releasing problematic fumes.",

    "response": "Answer (Yes or No?): Yes\n\n**Explanation:**  \nMichael’s use of L Q200T in sections where S P300C had already been applied (by Emma) directly contributed to the harmful fumes, which caused the allergic reactions. While Emma failed to inform Michael of the new policy, the causal chain hinges on Michael’s action of using L Q200T in combination with S P300C. Without his use of L Q200T in those sections, the irritants would not have been released.

Since Alex was two points behind the fifth-place score (Carter’s score), removing Carter’s participation would lower the cutoff to Alex’s score (now fifth), allowing Alex to qualify.

Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective.

Benni tells Tom that Alex had told him that they were only supposed to use B Y33R. He therefore only used B Y33R without knowing that Tom actually intended both gardeners to use A X200R. Tom realizes that the plants dried up in the flower beds on which both A X200R and B Y33R were applied by the gardeners.",
    "query": "Did Benni cause the plant to dry out?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation:**  \nBenni's use of B Y33R was a necessary component in causing the plants to dry out. The damage occurred only when **both** A X200R (applied by Alex) and B Y33R (applied by Benni) were used on the same flower beds. Without Benni’s application of B Y33R, the harmful interaction would not have occurred, even if Alex used A X200R. While Benni acted under false instructions from Alex, his action (applying B Y33R) was still a direct cause of the outcome in the context of the causal mechanism described (damage from combined fertilizers). Actual causality focuses on the factual contribution to the outcome, not intent or knowledge, making Benni’s action a cause.",

    "story": "In a small countryside village, a large decorative pond in the central park had remained dry for years because it required at least one functional pump to carry water from the nearby stream. However, no pump had been installed yet. Emma, a local gardener passionate about revitalizing the park, decided to look for solutions. On her way back from a nearby town, she visited a hardware store and found a perfect pump on discount. She instantly purchased it, thinking it would help. Meanwhile, Jack, an engineer who had recently moved into the village, was browsing an online marketplace during his break at work and discovered a pump for sale at a reasonable price. Recognizing the chance to contribute to the park restoration, Jack bought the pump and arranged for it to be delivered directly. That weekend, Emma and Jack, unaware of each other's actions, both arrived at the park with their pumps. They installed both devices, connecting them to the stream, and as soon as one was operational, water began flowing into the pond, restoring its beauty.",
    "query": "Did Emma cause the pond to start filling with water?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation:**  \nEmma's installation of her pump was an actual cause of the pond filling because her action contributed to a sufficient condition for the outcome. While Jack's pump alone would also have sufficed, causal frameworks like the NESS test or overdetermination cases recognize that multiple sufficient causes can coexist. Both Emma and Jack's actions are valid causes since either pump independently ensured the pond filled. Thus, Emma's action directly participated in the causal chain leading to the result.",

Beneath his professional life, he lived with a serious health condition called Hentler's anomaly, a disorder that severely limited his ability to metabolize sulfites, often present in foods preserved with specific additives. Even minor exposure to these substances could put David’s life at risk. Following a record-breaking month for the factory, Mr. Robbins, the manager, organized a celebratory team dinner at an upscale Italian restaurant. Known for being generous on such occasions, Mr. Robbins took it upon himself to select dishes for each team member. After looking over the menu, he momentarily thought of choosing Veal Piccata for David but instead picked Shrimp Scampi, unaware of its preparation with a wine-based sauce containing sulfites—something the Veal Piccata did not include. David ate his meal, seemingly enjoying the evening, until he began to feel faint and complained about a sharp dizziness.

As the festival emphasized perfect pie crusts, Sarah ordered two specialty flours: SuperFine 101A, known for its velvety smoothness, and HighRise 202B, ideal for fluffy textures. However, in her research, she discovered that combining these two particular flours often led to disastrous results like sunken or gummy pies. To avoid this, Sarah made it clear that they should exclusively use SuperFine 101A. Jake agreed to portion out the flour and ensure everything was ready for Emma and himself. After the frenzy of preparation, the festival commenced, but soon some pies were found to have collapsed with strange, uneven textures. Alarmed, Sarah began investigating.

The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective.

Among the regulars are Alice, an avid reader of classic novels; Ben, who enjoys sci-fi; Clara, a lover of mysteries; and Dave, a history buff. For the bookstore to cover its operating expenses and make a profit, at least one purchase needs to be made each day. On this particular Friday, as usual, Alice picked up a copy of her favorite author’s newly released collection. Ben found an intriguing sci-fi book, Clara grabbed the latest mystery novel, and Dave added a history book to his collection. With at least one book sold, the bookstore comfortably surpassed its threshold to make a profit for the day.",
    "query": "Did Alice buying a book on Friday cause the bookstore to turn a profit that day?",
    "response": "Answer: No\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe bookstore required at least one purchase to turn a profit. Since Ben, Clara, and Dave also bought books, the profit would have occurred even if Alice had not made her purchase. Alice’s action was sufficient but not necessary for the outcome, so it is not an actual cause under standard counterfactual or necessity-based definitions of causation.",

Jim, prohibited from using his lamp on Thursdays, turned his on at 8 PM, overlapping with Carol's action. Without Jim's action, only Carol would have used her lamp (a single user), and the breaker would not have failed.

The two bakers organize their tasks independently, and Sarah has never needed to micromanage them because of their professionalism. Wanting to introduce a new premium cupcake line for the upcoming holiday season, she decides to improve the flavor profile. After reading an article in a bakery trade journal, Sarah learns that adding high-quality vanilla extract can significantly enhance sweetness and aroma. The journal highlights two standout brands: Brand V Pure for its balanced flavor and Brand S Premium for its robust notes. However, it also strongly warns that combining extracts from different brands can create an incompatible, bitter flavor. Wanting the best results, Sarah decides to exclusively use Brand V Pure. At the next team meeting, Sarah announces her decision and tasks Emma with purchasing multiple bottles of Brand V Pure for their daily use. A few weeks later, Sarah tastes several batches of cupcakes and is surprised that some taste perfect while others are unpleasantly bitter. Confused and concerned about her new premium line, Sarah speaks separately to Emma and Charlie. Emma assures her that she followed instructions and used only the purchased Brand V Pure extract. Charlie, however, admits he still had leftover bottles of Brand S Premium extract at home, which he used to avoid waste. Sarah connects the dots and determines that the bitterness only occurs in batches where extracts from both brands were combined in the batter.",

As the head chef responsible for this task, his inaction was a critical factor. While Sarah could have intervened, her role was secondary (focused on desserts), and her preoccupation does not negate Michael’s primary responsibility. Using the counterfactual test: if Michael had set the timer, the dish would not have burned, even if Sarah remained occupied. Thus, his omission was an actual cause.",

On this Thursday, Jim (who was not supposed to use his lamp), Carol, and Bob all turned on their lamps at the same time, resulting in three concurrent uses. If Jim had not turned on his lamp, only two people (Carol and Bob) would have used their lamps, avoiding the failure.

That evening, Mia scheduled a rideshare to take them downtown, and they stood waiting near their driveway, discussing the concert program. When the rideshare arrived, the driver quickly noticed their dogs and explained he couldn’t accept the trip due to severe allergies. Apologizing hastily, he left. Pressed for time and unwilling to miss the concert, Mia decided they should walk to their friend Sarah’s, who had offered the use of her car when needed. To get there, they had to cross a poorly maintained railway line, which was rarely used but still posed risks. Unfortunately, the rideshare driver had crossed it just minutes earlier before a circuit problem disabled the track’s signals and gates. As Mia and Daniel approached the crossing, they didn’t notice the warning signs' absence in the growing darkness. A train, moving faster than usual for that track, struck them as they crossed.

The Scientific Merit Committee routinely supports research with promising scientific impact, and Dr. Jones was confident they would approve her proposal.

Midway through the match, Jordan notices an opponent's Defender concealed behind a stack of barrels near one of the main pathways.

Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. When Tom meets Alex in the garden shortly afterwards, he instructs him to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. He also explicitly instructs him to tell Benni to only use A X200R. Alex volunteers to buy several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself and to tell Benni about Tom's instruction. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up.

At the same time, Jack, a worker on the east end, receives a green signal on his screen, instructing him to proceed with operating the crane. The crane's structural base, unknown to anyone, has weakened significantly due to ongoing stress and a recent undetected flaw in the metal foundation. If only one worker uses the crane at a time, the structure might still hold, but simultaneous operations will overload and cause its collapse. Overlooking her red signal, Emma decides to operate the crane to lift a large container, synchronized with the exact moment Jack starts his own hoist. This dual strain immediately results in the structural base failing, and the crane collapses, spilling materials across the site.",

    "response": "Answer: Yes  \n**Explanation:** Emma's decision to operate the crane despite the red signal directly contributed to the simultaneous use that overloaded the weakened structure. While the structural flaw and Jack's concurrent operation were also necessary conditions, Emma's action was a critical factor without which the collapse would not have occurred at that moment.

This afternoon, he had arranged to meet his colleague, Dr. Harris, at a quaint cafe near the university they both worked at. The cafe was bustling with students and professionals, and they found a small table near the windows overlooking the campus gardens. During their meeting, Dr. Leonard excused himself to answer a call from his assistant regarding an upcoming clinical trial. While Dr. Leonard was focused on his phone call, Dr. Harris discreetly added a highly concentrated toxin to Dr. Leonard’s cappuccino. The toxin, developed for stealthy application, was known to cause death within an hour depending on individual metabolic rates, with no symptoms visible in the first 30 minutes.

Every day, he would stay a few minutes after class to ensure everything was tidy for the next session. Because of this routine, Tom knows exactly how to use the erasers and cleaning spray to keep the board spotless. Sarah, who sits near the whiteboard, does not have the responsibility to clean it, although she observed how to use the cleaning supplies when Tom explained it early on. One busy afternoon after an important exam, Tom was distracted and left the classroom without cleaning the whiteboard. He did not realize his mistake. Sarah, busy talking with other friends, also missed noticing the messy whiteboard and did not interfere. Over the next few days, nobody cleaned the whiteboard, and layers of old notes covered it, making it unreadable for teachers and students during lessons.",

    "response": "Answer: Yes.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nTom's failure to clean the whiteboard on that specific day initiated the causal chain. If he had cleaned it as usual, the board would have been reset, preventing the initial buildup. Subsequent days’ neglect (by Tom and others) compounded the problem, but the first instance of neglect was a necessary condition for the eventual outcome. Without Tom’s initial omission, the layers of mess would not have started accumulating, making his inaction a critical actual cause under standard causal frameworks (e.g., counterfactual dependence).",

To move forward with her latest initiative aimed at developing more efficient solar panels, Dr. Carter must submit her project proposal to two critical review panels: the environmental impact panel, which evaluates the ecological sustainability of the project, and the funding allocation panel, which determines its financial feasibility. Interestingly, within the agency, the environmental impact panel has a strong reputation for supporting almost all proposals, as their primary goal is to promote eco-friendly projects. In contrast, the funding allocation panel is notoriously stringent, turning down the vast majority of requests to focus on budget limitations. With a mixture of hope and doubt, Dr. Carter submits her proposal to both panels. Each panel works in complete isolation to avoid bias, and their assessments occur simultaneously. When the decision day arrives, the environmental impact panel readily approves Dr. Carter's proposal, as expected. Unexpectedly, the funding allocation panel, despite their typical behavior, also grants approval to her project. With both panels' green lights, Dr. Carter's ambitious solar panel project officially receives agency approval.",

Recently, Emma decided it was time to enhance her most popular pastries further after noticing that competitors had started experimenting with new ingredients. She came across information in a culinary journal that recommended using premium butter for richer flavors. Intrigued, she selected a top-quality product called ButterGold and decided it would be their standard ingredient for all baked goods moving forward. One morning, before heading to an important supplier meeting, Emma called Lisa to her office. She asked Lisa to purchase ButterGold immediately and use it for all their pastries. Additionally, she gave Lisa clear instructions to inform Noah about using only ButterGold and not to experiment with any other butter types. Later that same day, Lisa assured Emma she would handle both the purchase and the communication with Noah. Over the next several weeks, Emma started receiving mixed feedback from her customers. While some raved about the incredible improvement in flavor, others complained about an odd aftertaste in certain pastries. Concerned, Emma investigated by directly questioning both Lisa and Noah.

However, Jamie’s unexpected early presence at 6 pm (due to the canceled class) directly satisfied the system’s requirement for both occupants to be home, resulting in the lights turning on earlier.

    "story": "In a small coastal town, Sarah was organizing a much-anticipated village pie festival. She had recruited two enthusiastic assistants, Jake and Emma, to help with pre-festival preparations. Sarah stressed the importance of using only high-quality ingredients she had provided and making sure any storage containers were labeled correctly. As the festival emphasized perfect pie crusts, Sarah ordered two specialty flours: SuperFine 101A, known for its velvety smoothness, and HighRise 202B, ideal for fluffy textures. However, in her research, she discovered that combining these two particular flours often led to disastrous results like sunken or gummy pies. To avoid this, Sarah made it clear that they should exclusively use SuperFine 101A. Jake agreed to portion out the flour and ensure everything was ready for Emma and himself. After the frenzy of preparation, the festival commenced, but soon some pies were found to have collapsed with strange, uneven textures. Alarmed, Sarah began investigating. Emma mentioned that she had been relying on instructions from Jake and had used the flour stored in a white container. Jake suddenly realized and admitted, \"Oh no! I told you the wrong container — SuperFine 101A is in the silver container. I didn’t check properly when I gave you that information.\" Emma then explained that, earlier that morning, she had also spotted HighRise 202B in the white container, completely unlabeled. Jake’s face fell as he admitted, \"That’s on me! I should’ve double-checked all the containers.\" Sarah concluded that some pies collapsed because recipes ended up using both SuperFine 101A and HighRise 202B as a result of Jake's mistake.",
    "query": "Did Emma cause the baked goods to collapse?",
    "response": "Answer: No\n\n**Explanation:** While Emma used the flour from the unlabeled white container, her actions were directly guided by Jake’s incorrect instructions and his failure to label the containers properly. Sarah had delegated the responsibility of labeling and verifying ingredients to Jake, and Emma relied on his authority. Though Emma noticed the unlabeled container, her role did not override Jake’s assigned task to ensure correct labeling. The collapse was primarily caused by Jake’s mistake in mislabeling and providing false information, not by Emma following his instructions. Thus, Emma’s actions were not the critical cause of the outcome under principles of actual causality.",

Lisa recently attended a culinary workshop, where a chef recommended a unique sugar substitute named SweetX for healthier and tastier desserts. The chef issued a warning: blending this substitute with others could ruin the flavors. Inspired, Lisa decides to adopt SweetX as the exclusive sugar substitute for her bakery. Lisa places an order for SweetX and, the next day, speaks to Sarah who arrives early to set up the kitchen. She explains the decision and instructs Sarah to only use SweetX in recipes from now on. Lisa also asks Sarah, who often communicates with Mike about daily responsibilities, to inform Mike of the new rule. Sarah agrees to handle it and also volunteers to stock the kitchen immediately.

He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division.

Under actual causality frameworks like counterfactual dependence, if John had not worked in the plastics division, he likely would not have developed cancer, avoided hospitalization, and thus not encountered the fatal error.

    "response": "Answer: No\n\nThe smartphone would have switched on regardless of Jane plugging it into the charger because the battery already had sufficient charge. The device's activation depends on either a charged battery *or* being connected to a charger, and the battery alone was sufficient in this case. Jane's action of plugging in the charger was not necessary for the outcome, so it is not the actual cause under standard definitions of actual causality (e.g., necessity in the causal process).",

    "story": "Lisa owns a boutique bakery that specializes in custom cakes. Her assistants, Sarah and Mike, are trusted to handle baking and experimenting with recipes. Lisa recently attended a culinary workshop, where a chef recommended a unique sugar substitute named SweetX for healthier and tastier desserts. The chef issued a warning: blending this substitute with others could ruin the flavors. Inspired, Lisa decides to adopt SweetX as the exclusive sugar substitute for her bakery. Lisa places an order for SweetX and, the next day, speaks to Sarah who arrives early to set up the kitchen. She explains the decision and instructs Sarah to only use SweetX in recipes from now on. Lisa also asks Sarah, who often communicates with Mike about daily responsibilities, to inform Mike of the new rule. Sarah agrees to handle it and also volunteers to stock the kitchen immediately. Over the following weeks, Lisa notices mixed feedback from customers. Curious, she samples the cakes herself. While some cakes are extraordinary, others have a bitter taste and unpleasant consistency. Concerned about what went wrong, Lisa holds a meeting with Sarah and Mike. At the meeting, Sarah admits to forgetting to inform Mike about the SweetX policy. Sarah clarifies that she herself exclusively used SweetX in her baking, but Mike reveals he continued using SugarZ, the sugar substitute they had used previously, as he hadn’t been told of any changes. Lisa remembers that SugarZ was stored in bright red-labeled jars in the pantry. Concluding from their discussion, Lisa determines that the bitter cakes resulted from batches where SweetX and SugarZ were accidentally combined.",
    "query": "Did Sarah cause the cakes to become bitter?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes  \nSarah's failure to inform Mike about the new SweetX policy directly led to him unknowingly using SugarZ, which—when combined with SweetX—caused the bitter cakes. Her omission was a critical link in the causal chain, making her action (or inaction) a cause of the outcome.",

Between two storage areas lies an old wooden platform that has been weakened over time and is clearly marked as unsafe for use. Jack, rushing to complete his task and ignoring the posted warning, decides to drive directly onto the platform despite its fragile condition. At the same time, Emma, following instructions from her supervisor and assuming the platform can handle the weight, begins crossing from the opposite side with her bulldozer. This simultaneous action places excessive weight on the platform, which immediately gives way, sending both machines and parts of the platform crashing to the ground below.",

    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe platform collapsed due to the combined weight of both bulldozers. While Jack acted recklessly by ignoring warnings, Emma’s simultaneous use of the platform was a necessary factor in exceeding its load capacity. A counterfactual analysis shows that if Emma had not driven onto the platform, the collapse likely would not have occurred (assuming the platform could have supported Jack’s bulldozer alone). Thus, her action was an actual cause of the collapse, even though she followed instructions. Both actions were jointly necessary for the outcome.",

His contributions made him both respected and a potential target among competitors eager to claim his secrets for their gain. His day started with an intimate lunch meeting with Dr. Calloway, a longtime collaborator who had recently grown distant. As the two conversed at a reserved conference room at the institute’s cafeteria, Dr. Reid briefly exited to field an urgent call with members of another research group. During this brief absence, Dr. Calloway acted on a secret instruction from unnamed agents by tipping a concealed vial containing a deadly laboratory-harvested poison into Dr. Reid's half-empty water bottle. The poison was nearly impossible to detect without specialized equipment and worked slowly, ensuring symptoms wouldn’t appear immediately. When Dr. Reid returned, unaware of the tampering, he quickly took a few large sips to stay hydrated and wrapped up the meeting amicably. He left shortly thereafter for a high-security nearby test facility located 10 miles out of town on a work-access-only road. Roughly halfway into his drive, he encountered an old delivery truck that started trailing his car at increasing speed. As the road narrowed, the truck jolted forward and smashed into his rear bumper repeatedly. Through his rearview mirror, Dr. Reid recognized the truck’s driver, Mr. Jacobs — a known associate of key figures in the cutthroat biotech competition circuit. Within a few sharp blows, Mr. Jacobs forced Dr. Reid’s car off the tarmac into a steep gorge. The impact set the vehicle ablaze, leaving little chance of escape.

Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants.

While grabbing her usual morning coffee at a nearby cafe, she spontaneously struck up a long conversation with a former colleague she hadn’t seen in years. This casual reunion caused Emma to lose track of time. Realizing she was running late, Emma entrusted her assistant, who was stationed in the office, to rush the key presentation materials to the meeting venue. The assistant, however, was struck by a reckless speeding motorist while en route. Fortunately, they escaped serious injury, but the presentation materials were not as lucky—they were completely destroyed in the crash. Emma’s colleagues often joked about her habit of losing herself in conversations, a trait that occasionally led to minor delays at work. Despite being aware of it, Emma found it challenging to rein in her social tendencies, especially in moments of spontaneity.",

    "response": "Answer: No.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe assistant's action (transporting the materials) was a necessary link in the causal chain but not the **actual cause** of the loss. The direct cause was the **reckless motorist** colliding with the assistant. The assistant was fulfilling their duty and did not act negligently or contribute to the crash. Actual causality focuses on the action that directly produced the outcome, which here is the motorist’s behavior. While Emma’s delay set the stage, and the assistant’s involvement was a condition for the materials being in harm’s way, neither qualifies as the primary cause under standard theories of causation (e.g., counterfactual dependence or interventionist accounts).

    "story": "Tom and Sarah, a married couple in their fifties, lived in a quiet village surrounded by forest. Both were visually impaired, and they had developed a remarkable ability to navigate based on sound and memory. Years ago, they met at a local community support group that focused on accessibility issues, and their friendship grew into love and marriage. On the day of their niece's wedding in a nearby city, Tom arranged a rideshare using an app and received confirmation for pickup. When the driver arrived at the designated location, he seemed surprised to find his passengers using guiding sticks. He quickly declined the fare, stating that he wasn’t confident handling their specific needs, and sped off. With time running out and no public transit available, Sarah suggested using an outdated motorcycle with a sidecar stored in a family friend’s garage. Despite the risks, they decided to take the makeshift vehicle to avoid missing the ceremony. To reach the city, they had to cross an old suspension bridge spanning Blight Creek, swollen from recent storms. Unknown to Tom and Sarah, the torrential rain had created serious cracks in the bridge's foundation. Shortly before they arrived, the rideshare driver who had refused them had attempted to cross the bridge. The weight of his car further destabilized it, and the center section collapsed just after he barely made it to safety. Moments later, as Tom and Sarah rode onto the bridge in the fading light, they failed to perceive the missing section. The motorbike plunged into the creek, throwing them into the churning water. Trapped by the force of the current, they both drowned, and search teams later recovered their bodies along with the remnants of their vehicle.",

The driver’s own car caused the bridge to collapse *before* Tom and Sarah attempted to cross it. If the driver had accepted them, they would have crossed the bridge *with him* in his car *before* the collapse occurred, avoiding the fatal accident.

Her two assistants, Mia and Ethan, are skilled in different aspects of baking, with Mia specializing in decoration and Ethan focusing on cake bases. Sarah recently attended a professional baking workshop, where a renowned chef emphasized that the right frosting can elevate cakes to a whole new level. Inspired, Sarah decides to adopt a specific frosting, Frosting A, which she believes will give her cakes a competitive edge. However, she also learns that mixing different types of frosting can ruin the taste and presentation of cakes. Determined to avoid this pitfall, Sarah privately explains her decision to Mia, emphasizing the need to use only Frosting A on all cakes moving forward. She relies on Mia to communicate this rule to Ethan, as Sarah leaves the bakery to attend additional workshops. Mia assures Sarah that she will handle everything, including purchasing Frosting A for both of them. Weeks later, Sarah returns and begins receiving mixed feedback from her customers. While some rave about the improvements in the cakes, others complain about bitter-tasting, poorly presented cakes. Concerned, Sarah inspects the leftover frostings in the bakery's storage. During her conversation with her assistants, Mia admits she completely forgot to inform Ethan about the new policy. Mia had been using Frosting A as instructed, but Ethan confesses he continued using the previously stored Frosting B, which was kept in a blue container. Realizing the problem, Sarah concludes that both Frostings A and B must have been applied to certain cakes by mistake, which caused those cakes to turn out poorly. Devastated by the ruined reputation of some of her cakes, Sarah resolves to reinforce better communication in her team to prevent such mishaps in the future.",

While helping the neighbor sort his barn, she noticed a dusty Fermon canister lying unused in a corner. Although her neighbor explained that he occasionally needed it, Emma decided to take it without asking while he was distracted sorting other items.

Perplexed, Linda decides to investigate by talking to Sarah and Mike. Sarah admits that she might have forgotten to inform Mike about using only GoldSweet. \"I've been using GoldSweet like you asked,\" Sarah explains, \"but I forgot to tell Mike. He must have been using the old syrup, ClassicSweet.\" When Linda confronts Mike, he confirms her suspicion, saying, \"I didn’t know we switched syrups. I’ve been using the yellow bottle of ClassicSweet we’ve had from before.\" Linda realizes that in some drinks, both syrups had inadvertently been used, creating the unpleasant flavors that left many customers dissatisfied.",
    "query": "Did Mike cause the drinks to have strange flavors?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation**: Mike's use of ClassicSweet syrup directly contributed to the creation of strange flavors when combined with GoldSweet, as warned by the supplier. The causal chain hinges on two necessary factors: (1) Sarah failed to inform Mike about the switch, and (2) Mike used ClassicSweet. Without Mike’s action (using ClassicSweet), the mixing (and resulting off-tastes) would not have occurred. While Sarah’s omission enabled the scenario, Mike’s choice to use ClassicSweet was a critical actual cause of the outcome under standard counterfactual reasoning (his action was a \"but-for\" cause of the harm).",

While John’s crane operation also contributed vibrations, his actions followed protocol (green signal) and were not negligent. Crucially, if Samantha had heeded the warning (a counterfactual scenario), her vibrations would have ceased, potentially averting the collapse even with John’s activity.

After analyzing the logs, the engineer identifies that a recently integrated recommendation engine is using excessive resources. The engineer recalls reading about a third-party patch designed to optimize the engine's resource consumption and decides it could be a viable solution. However, applying the patch requires two approvals: one from the quality assurance team, which must verify the patch for potential risks, and another from the project manager, who must evaluate whether the patch adheres to company guidelines. The engineer forwards both approval requests simultaneously. The quality assurance team promptly analyzes the patch, finds it effective and safe, and provides their approval. The project manager, however, quickly realizes that the company policy prohibits the usage of external patches without conducting extensive internal evaluations. Despite this clear policy, and given the urgency of the situation, the project manager decides to overrule the rules and approve applying the patch. Once the engineer receives both approvals, they immediately deploy the patch to the live system. The page loading times improve significantly, and no additional technical issues are observed as a result of the fix.",

The story's conclusion (Alice displaying both) is inconsistent with Tom's theft unless there is an unstated resolution (e.g., Alice recovered the stolen painting).

He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him.

Both Alex and Jamie independently activated the system at this exact time, and the malfunction occurred. While either action alone might have been sufficient to cause the malfunction (as stated: \"activating it at 6:15 am **can** cause a malfunction\"), the simultaneous activation by both Alex and Jamie directly led to the overwatering. Under standard theories of actual causality (e.g., overdetermination), **each action is considered a cause** because both were part of the actual sequence of events that produced the outcome. Even if Jamie’s action alone could have sufficed, Alex’s action was still a contributing cause in the specific instance. Thus, Alex’s activation of the system qualifies as an actual cause of the overwatering.",

Two skilled baristas, Rachel and Sam, handle the café’s coffee-making duties, bringing their own flair to the process. Lisa recently attended a coffee workshop where experts recommended switching to a premium coffee bean brand called RoastPure to elevate flavor consistency and quality. One key point she remembered from the workshop was a warning: blending different coffee bean brands can create an unpleasant bitterness in the brew. Determined to follow this advice, Lisa orders a fresh supply of RoastPure beans for the café and decides all drinks should be made exclusively with this brand going forward. She informs Rachel about this new rule before the start of her morning shift, asking her to use only RoastPure and to make sure Sam, who works in the afternoon, is also notified. Rachel enthusiastically agrees to the change and assures Lisa that she will communicate the instruction to Sam. Despite this, weeks later, Lisa begins noticing conflicting feedback from customers. Some praise the delightful, rich coffee taste, while others complain of an odd bitterness in their cups. Unsure of what’s causing this, Lisa starts investigating. Rachel admits during a meeting, \"I completely forgot to tell Sam about the change!

    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe bitterness resulted from blending two different coffee bean brands (RoastPure and CaféBlend) during preparation, as warned in the workshop. While Rachel used RoastPure, Sam unknowingly continued using CaféBlend due to Rachel’s failure to inform him. For the coffee to taste bitter, both bean types had to be mixed. Sam’s preparation with CaféBlend was necessary for this mix to occur, making his actions a direct cause of the bitterness in some drinks.

Her two baristas, Emily and Jack, work creatively and flexibly to craft beverages that attract customers. Emily enjoys experimenting with new techniques, while Jack prides himself on quick and efficient preparation. One evening, Sarah attends a regional coffee expo where she learns about premium syrups that elevate drink quality. The presenters recommend Syrup A and Syrup B, cautioning, however, that combining different syrups in the same recipe could produce undesirable flavors. Inspired, Sarah decides to implement a single-syrup policy in her shop to maintain high quality. After discussing with her team, she selects Syrup A for all recipes and asks her baristas to use only this syrup moving forward. Emily offers to visit the supplier to buy Syrup A for their shop. A few weeks later, Sarah notices a shift in customer reactions: many drinks receive glowing reviews, but others are criticized for tasting strangely off. Concerned, Sarah checks with her team. Emily explains that she adhered strictly to the plan and consistently used Syrup A. Jack confesses that, although he initially intended to comply, he opted to use leftover Syrup B from his personal stash to avoid waste. Upon further investigation, Sarah identifies that the unpleasant-tasting drinks were made from recipes in which both Syrup A and Syrup B accidentally came into play.",

    "response": "Answer: Yes  \n**Explanation**: Jack's decision to use Syrup B instead of adhering to the single-syrup policy (Syrup A) directly introduced Syrup B into the recipes. Since combining Syrups A and B was explicitly cautioned against (as it causes undesirable flavors), Jack's use of Syrup B was a critical factor in creating the odd-tasting drinks.

His success, however, created fierce competition among rival corporations. At a prestigious industry conference, Dr. Langley met with a fellow researcher, Dr. Meyer, during the lunch break. While discussing potential collaborations, Dr. Langley stepped aside to take an urgent call from one of his research assistants. Seizing the opportunity, Dr. Meyer discreetly introduced a rare and highly toxic chemical into Dr. Langley’s half-finished coffee. The toxin, as later confirmed, causes no side effects for approximately 30 minutes but leads to organ failure within the hour. Oblivious, Dr. Langley returned, finished his coffee, and left the conference shortly afterward to return to his laboratory in a rural, secure facility. During his drive, an unmarked black SUV aggressively followed his car just as he entered a secluded wooded road.

In actual causality, a cause must be necessary in the specific context for the effect to occur. Since the technology board's approval was already sufficient (and occurred first), the financial board's approval was redundant.

To claim the winner's trophy, Emma's dish needs to either achieve a score above 2—a relatively easy requirement—or include the rare and prestigious 'premium' garnish. Most contestants easily score above 2, and the simulator often chooses the 'premium' garnish by design. Emma puts great effort into creating her dish, and when the results are revealed, Emma's dish scores a 10, which was anticipated due to her skills, and the simulator also assigns the 'premium' garnish to her dish. With these outcomes, Emma is crowned the champion, receiving resounding applause from the audience.",
    "query": "Did the garnish assignment result cause Emma to win the competition?",
    "response": "Answer: No.\n\n**Explanation**:  \nEmma's victory was determined by her dish achieving a score above 2 **or** having the 'premium' garnish. Since her score of 10 (well above the required threshold) was sufficient to satisfy the victory condition, the 'premium' garnish was not a necessary cause of her win. In a counterfactual scenario where the garnish was absent, she would still have won due to her score. Thus, the garnish assignment was not the actual cause of her victory.",

Both bakers bring their individual flair to the recipes and have the freedom to coordinate their respective workloads. Sarah, always striving for perfection, decides to experiment with upgrading her ingredients. While attending a culinary workshop, she learns that specific premium flours—Golden Wheat Flour or Alpine White Flour—can significantly improve pastry quality. However, chefs at the workshop caution against mixing these specialized flours in the same batch, providing examples of prior mishaps. Inspired but cautious, Sarah resolves to standardize her future recipes by using only Golden Wheat Flour. She discusses this plan with her team and assigns Emma to purchase enough Golden Wheat Flour for everyone. A few weeks into this change, Sarah notices something peculiar—while some pastries are receiving rave customer reviews for their exceptional taste and texture, others are being returned for tasting strangely dense and sour. Concerned about this unexpected outcome, Sarah investigates. Emma assures her that she consistently used Golden Wheat Flour, following instructions. However, Jake admits that he had been secretly using leftover Alpine White Flour in some of his preparations due to a personal preference for its texture.

Official policy specifies that office assistants can take paper directly from the stock for general office use, but creative team members, including designers, are responsible for purchasing their own materials. Despite several warning emails about this rule, designers often grab paper when they need it. On Thursday afternoon, Designer Taylor stops by the supply closet to grab a stack of paper, stating they need it for an urgent presentation. An office assistant, organizing items in the supply closet, retrieves some paper for a printer and leaves with it shortly after. By the end of the day, an intern attempts to refill the largest office printer but finds that every last sheet of paper is gone, leaving printing jobs stalled across the office.",
    "query": "Did the office assistant cause the problem?",
    "response": "Answer: **No**\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe office assistant was acting within official policy by retrieving paper, which they are permitted to do. The problem (paper depletion) primarily stems from Designer Taylor's unauthorized taking of paper, a recurring violation despite warnings. While the assistant's action contributed to the total depletion, the root cause is the designers' non-compliant behavior. In actual causality, the key factor is whether the outcome would still occur without the action. Here, Taylor's violation alone could have led to the shortage, making the assistant's permissible action not the decisive cause. Thus, the assistant's role doesn't constitute the actual cause of the problem.",

Liam is part of the vessel's maintenance crew and is tasked with inspecting and maintaining the fishing nets. This job is critical because damaged nets can lead to a significant loss of the catch. Olivia, another crew member responsible for overseeing the on-deck storage of fish, has knowledge of net inspections but is focused on her own specialized tasks related to catch management. On a busy morning before departure, Liam skips the net inspection, believing there isn't enough time to complete it. He later realizes the oversight but chooses not to address it. Meanwhile, Olivia is preoccupied ensuring the fish storage systems are functioning properly and has no reason to suspect issues with the nets. When the vessel begins its fishing operations, a tear in one of the uninspected nets results in a major loss of fish, leading to significant financial loss for the crew.",

To keep up with demand, she hires two assistants, Liam and Mia, with clear roles: Liam focuses on dough preparation, and Mia oversees filling and flavoring. Sarah recently attended a baking expo where she learned that flavor consistency could be improved using flavor enhancers. She was particularly impressed with a lecture recommending two enhancers, X ZT45A and Y UK88B, but also received a stern warning: combining these two enhancers in the same pastry could lead to disastrous results. Back at the bakery, Sarah decides to implement this improvement cautiously. She chooses ZT45A, ordering it and instructing Liam and Mia to only use this enhancer. To ensure clarity, she explains details but does not inspect their work directly. Liam offers to label the red container in which ZT45A is stored for both of them to use. Weeks later, a regular customer complains about pastries tasting unpleasant, leading Sarah to scrutinize the situation. Confronted, Liam insists he used ZT45A exclusively from the red container, but Mia interjects. \"Red? You told me the yellow container had ZT45A in it! That's the one I've been using all this time!\" Mia’s eyes widen when Sarah admits the yellow container had a leftover batch of UK88B from a recipe she had experimented with months ago but abandoned. Without realizing it, Mia had been using the wrong enhancer. The next day, Sarah reviews the production logs and notes that the pastries with complaints all had both ZT45A and UK88B added to them. She begins rethinking her labeling and communication strategies to avoid future mishaps.",

    "response": "Answer: Yes  \n**Explanation**: Mia mistakenly used the enhancer UK88B (from the yellow container) instead of ZT45A as instructed. Since the combination of ZT45A (used by Liam) and UK88B (used by Mia) was explicitly warned to cause unpleasant results, Mia’s action was a necessary and direct cause of the undesirable taste.

By 2:00 PM, the power switch has already been turned on for the initial tests, and lever B remains in the raised position. Lisa inspects the lever's status during her final system checks and notices that it is raised. To ensure proper functionality during the rotation process, she decides to move the lever down.

Her team consists of two assistants, Lisa and Noah, both of whom have been working with her for a year. Recently, Emma decided it was time to enhance her most popular pastries further after noticing that competitors had started experimenting with new ingredients. She came across information in a culinary journal that recommended using premium butter for richer flavors. Intrigued, she selected a top-quality product called ButterGold and decided it would be their standard ingredient for all baked goods moving forward. One morning, before heading to an important supplier meeting, Emma called Lisa to her office. She asked Lisa to purchase ButterGold immediately and use it for all their pastries. Additionally, she gave Lisa clear instructions to inform Noah about using only ButterGold and not to experiment with any other butter types. Later that same day, Lisa assured Emma she would handle both the purchase and the communication with Noah. Over the next several weeks, Emma started receiving mixed feedback from her customers. While some raved about the incredible improvement in flavor, others complained about an odd aftertaste in certain pastries. Concerned, Emma investigated by directly questioning both Lisa and Noah. Under pressure, Lisa admitted that, despite her assurances, she provided Noah with false instructions. She told him Emma actually wanted them to use a cheaper, subpar butter brand called ButterLow. Her intent was to make Noah look bad in front of Emma, exploiting any customer complaints to strengthen her own position. Throughout this period, Lisa used only ButterGold for her recipes. Noah, on the other hand, unaware of Emma’s real preference, exclusively used ButterLow, following Lisa’s misdirection. After carefully reviewing which pastries had issues, Emma realized the strange aftertaste came from pastries where traces of ButterGold and ButterLow had inadvertently been mixed during preparation.",

The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R.

    "story": "Dr. Blake was a renowned scientist whose groundbreaking research on renewable energy earned him fame, and with it, adversaries in the energy industry fearing for their profits. One evening, after delivering a keynote speech at an environmental gala, he was invited to a private dinner hosted by his colleague, Dr. Carter, to discuss potential collaborations. While discussing the future of sustainable technology, Dr. Blake got up to take a phone call about a time-sensitive grant proposal. During his absence, Dr. Carter laced Dr. Blake's wine with a rare, odorless poison. The poison was known among industrial chemists for its delayed but deadly effects, taking approximately an hour to incapacitate its victim. Oblivious, Dr. Blake returned to the table, drained his glass of wine, and wrapped up the evening cheerfully before heading back to his car. His laboratory was located 20 minutes away in a quiet suburban technology park surrounded by wooded areas. As Dr. Blake was traversing a dimly lit road near the park, a black truck emerged from a concealed turn-off and began tailgating him aggressively. In his rearview mirror, Dr. Blake recognized the driver as Mr. Hughes, known to be working for a rival energy corporation with a history of sabotaging similar research. The truck swerved violently and struck Dr. Blake's car, causing it to lose traction and plummet into a nearby ravine. The vehicle exploded upon impact. Firefighters and paramedics arrived at the scene but could only recover his burnt remains. The coroner's report later revealed the cause of death as severe burns from the car fire, though toxicology findings confirmed the poison in his system would have killed him regardless within minutes.",
    "query": "Did Dr. Blake's scientific rivalry cause his death?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes.\n\n**Explanation**: Dr. Blake's death resulted from two actions motivated by scientific rivalry: Dr. Carter’s poisoning (stemming from adversarial interests in renewable energy) and Mr. Hughes’s attack (linked to a rival corporation’s sabotage efforts). While the car crash directly caused his death, the poison (also a result of rivalry) would have independently killed him moments later. Both causes trace back to the rivalry, satisfying overdetermination in actual causality. Thus, the rivalry is the root cause of his death.",

Throughout the day, the head chef and the junior waiter mistakenly or knowingly took turns picking the mushrooms for their own tasks.

Actual causality focuses on whether the action was a necessary part of the causal chain.

Although the process is typically smooth because both boards independently approve most requests, only one committee's approval is actually needed for purchases to proceed. Dr. Patel submits her application, emphasizing the urgency of replacing the MRI machine. The Equipment Review Board, known for being highly efficient and  supportive about essential upgrades, has a meeting scheduled at the same time as the Finance Approval Board, which rarely denies funding requests.

Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. When Tom meets Alex in the garden shortly afterwards, he instructs him to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. He also explicitly instructs him to tell Benni to only use A X200R. Alex volunteers to buy several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself and to tell Benni about Tom's instruction. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up. That makes Tom very sad and reflective. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. Alex immediately starts apologizing: \"I am sorry! I completely forgot to tell Benni about the rule!

He explains: \"I have used the fertilizer I previously used; it is called B Y33R!\" Tom remembers that he had filled B Y33R in a green can - long before he had read about the chemicals in his magazine.

The technology board is known for swiftly approving these requests, particularly for essential tools like diagnostic machines. However, the finance board rarely approves such expensive purchases, as it adopts a strict stance to avoid budget overruns. Dr. Johnson submits her proposal, and both boards convene separately on the same day to decide. Their discussions are conducted in isolation from one another. After the meetings, Dr. Johnson learns that the technology board has approved her request, as expected, but surprisingly, the finance board has also decided to grant its approval. With this unexpected double endorsement, the hospital administration orders the new diagnostic machine for her department.",
    "query": "Does the finance board cause Dr. Johnson's request to be approved?",
    "response": "Answer: No. \n\n**Explanation:** The finance board's approval was not a necessary cause because the technology board's approval alone sufficed for the request to be approved. Even if the finance board had denied the request (as usual), the outcome (approval) would still have occurred due to the technology board's approval. In causal terms, the finance board’s decision was redundant in this specific scenario, making it not an actual cause under counterfactual or necessity-based analyses.",

    "story": "Maria owns a quaint bakery that specializes in high-quality pastries and cakes. To handle the growing demand during the holiday season, she recently hired Jessica and Liam as assistant bakers. Maria emphasizes her love for consistent quality and assigns Jessica to oversee the chocolate-based recipes. Although their roles are well-defined, Maria allows Jessica and Liam some flexibility in deciding how to split their daily tasks. Looking to innovate her menu, Maria decides to introduce a premium chocolate ganache using chocolate type C Z100, which she believes will elevate the flavor of desserts. She specifically tells Jessica to use only C Z100 for all ganache preparations and asks her to ensure Liam follows the same instructions. Jessica agrees but has hidden motives—she wants to outshine Liam and aims to make him look incompetent in front of Maria. Instead of passing on the correct instructions, Jessica falsely informs Liam that Maria preferred him to use a cheaper and less compatible chocolate, D Q45. While Jessica uses only C Z100 in her assigned recipes, Liam unknowingly uses D Q45 for his tasks, trusting Jessica's guidance. After a few weeks, Maria notices that some desserts have a luxurious taste reminiscent of her vision, but others have an odd bitterness that disappoints her customers. Maria investigates and discovers the truth: desserts made with a mixture of C Z100 and D Q45 developed an unpleasant bitter flavor due to an unforeseen reaction between the two chocolate types. Jessica admits to her scheme of giving Liam the wrong instructions, leaving Maria deeply frustrated over the sabotage of her bakery's reputation.",

The bitterness arose specifically from the mixture of C Z100 (used by Jessica) and D Q45 (used by Liam). If Liam had used the correct chocolate (C Z100) as instructed, no reaction would have occurred. While Jessica’s deception initiated the scenario, Liam’s action of using D Q45 directly contributed to the outcome, making it a but-for cause.",

These thermostats are connected to the building's central electrical system, which has a safety mechanism to prevent energy overloads. However, the system has a hidden flaw: if two or more thermostats are set to high in overlapping intervals, the central circuit breaker trips and causes a temporary power outage for the entire building. To address this, building management requested that all residents follow a schedule: Mark is advised to set his thermostat to high only during the nighttime hours, while Sarah is advised to do so in the daytime. On a cold winter evening, at 8 pm, Sarah adjusts her smart thermostat to high, deciding it’s too cold despite the guideline. Meanwhile, Mark, unaware of Sarah’s actions, sets his thermostat to high shortly after to warm his apartment. Within moments, the building's power goes out as the system overloads and trips the circuit breaker, affecting all residents.",

Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. Tom instructs Alex and Benni to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. Alex volunteers for buying several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up. That makes Tom very sad and reflective. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. Alex tells him that he followed Tom's instruction: \"I only bought and used the chemical A X200R which I had funneled into the blue can.\" Benni suddenly is startled and says to Alex: \"What? You funneled A X200R into the blue can? But you told me you had funneled it into the green can! That's why I always used the green can!\" Alex replies: \"Did I? Then I am sorry!\" Tom remembers that he had filled B Y33R in a green can - long before he had read about the chemicals in his magazine. He had never used it. So Benni must have accidentally, without knowing it, applied the chemical B Y33R, whereas only Alex applied A X200R.

Both employees have proven themselves to be diligent workers, which makes Lucy proud of her team. However, Lucy has been aiming to further improve the taste and presentation of her cakes to elevate the bakery’s reputation. During a pastry competition she recently attended, Lucy learned that the type of icing directly influences both the flavor and appearance of the cakes. Professional judges at the competition recommended using either Icing Mix C for its rich taste or Icing Mix D for its aesthetic shine. However, they also issued a stern warning: mixing different icing types on the same batch of cakes can completely ruin both the flavor and texture. Taking this advice seriously, Lucy decided to standardize her recipes and use only Icing Mix C for all cake decorations moving forward. A day later, while reviewing the bakery’s inventory, Lucy explained her decision to Emma. She instructed Emma to purchase an adequate stock of Icing Mix C and explicitly informed her to ensure that Jack also uses only Icing Mix C.

At the last moment, she opted to order the Italian Sub for Michael, thinking it was a safe and hearty choice. Unbeknownst to Ms. Reynolds, both sandwiches were prepared using ingredients containing nitrates. Michael savored the meal, praising her choice, but shortly after finishing, he began to feel dizzy and weak. Within minutes, his condition took a drastic turn, escalating into respiratory arrest. Though an ambulance arrived quickly, Michael tragically passed en route to the hospital, leaving his colleagues devastated.",
    "query": "Did Ms. Reynolds' choice of dish cause Michael's death?",
    "response": "Answer: No.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nMs. Reynolds' choice of the Italian Sub did not cause Michael's death because **both available sandwich options contained nitrates**, which were the actual cause of his fatal reaction. Since Michael's condition would have been triggered regardless of her choice (as both the Italian Sub and the Grilled Turkey Panini included nitrate-containing ingredients), her specific decision did not alter the outcome. In causal terms, her action was not a \"but-for cause\" (changing her choice would not have prevented the result), and the outcome was overdetermined by the presence of nitrates in all plausible options. Thus, while her action initiated the causal chain, it is not the critical factor in the actual causation of his death.",

    "story": "Lisa owns a thriving bakery in the heart of town, known for its delectable cakes. She has two skilled assistants, Sarah and Emma, who share her passion for creating delicious baked goods. Lisa recently attended a baking workshop where she learned that butter and margarine are both excellent ingredients for achieving moist cakes when used individually. However, during the workshop, the instructor emphasized that combining butter and margarine in the same batter could lead to a baking failure, such as dense and unappealing cakes. Taking this advice to heart, Lisa decides to only use butter moving forward and instructs Sarah and Emma to strictly adhere to this one-ingredient policy. To ensure things run smoothly, Sarah takes charge of purchasing all the required baking supplies and stocks the kitchen with high-quality butter. A few weeks later, Lisa notices that some of their cakes are receiving complaints from customers for being unusually flat and heavy. Alarmed, Lisa reviews the baking logs and questions her team. Sarah confirms that she followed the instruction of using only butter in every batter. However, Emma hesitantly confesses that she used a leftover supply of margarine stored at her home, wanting to avoid waste. Upon inspecting the affected recipes, Lisa uncovers that the dense cakes came from batches where both butter and margarine were unknowingly combined in the same batter, contradicting the guidelines given at the workshop.",
    "query": "Did Emma cause the cakes to become dense?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes  \n**Explanation:** Emma's action of adding margarine to the batter directly introduced the combination of butter and margarine, which the workshop identified as the cause of dense cakes.

However, this act of kindness sidelined her timing, and she missed the last bus heading to her neighborhood. When Ella called her roommate to explain the situation, her roommate, concerned for her safety, insisted on driving to the bus station to pick her up. During their ride home through the winding streets of the city, they approached a major intersection where a distracted driver, engrossed in their phone, ran a red light and smashed into their car.

She recently invested in a high-end coffee machine to improve the service quality and tasked her two employees, Lily and Noah, with getting it ready for use before the weekend rush. Emma provided a detailed manual, and Lily confidently volunteered to manage the water tank setup while Noah took charge of the coffee bean system. The café had two water tanks, one labeled 'white' and the other 'black,' which were used for different purposes. Lily prepared what she assumed was the 'white' tank, ensuring it was filled with purified water, while Noah worked on his part. Unfortunately, a mix-up occurred when Lily mistakenly referred to the black tank as the white one during their discussion. Following her instructions, Noah added coffee beans into the black tank. This tank, as Emma later remembered, still contained traces of an experimental cleaning solution from a month ago, which had been overlooked after initial tests. Over the next few days, customers began giving split feedback about the coffee—some praising its refined flavor, while others complained of a strange, charred aftertaste. Alarmed, Emma stopped using the machine and investigated the problem. When she revisited both tanks, the issue became clear: Noah had unknowingly allowed the coffee beans to come into contact with the cleaning solution remnants in the black tank. The burnt aftertaste was strongest in coffee brewed from these beans. Emma realized the mishap stemmed from both the long-forgotten cleaning solution and the confusion caused by Lily's error in identifying the correct tank.",

    "response": "Answer: Yes  \n**Explanation**: Noah's action of adding coffee beans to the black tank directly resulted in their contact with the residual cleaning solution, which caused the burnt aftertaste. While Lily’s error in tank identification and the preexisting residue were contributing factors, Noah’s role in physically introducing the beans to the contaminated tank was a necessary and direct cause of the outcome.

The group is unaware of an unusual phenomenon: if two volunteers add organic matter to the central compost bin at exactly the same time, chemical reactions accelerate, instantly transforming the contents into rich compost. To ensure proper organization, the project committee established a rule: Alice is permitted to use the bin only during the mornings, and John is only authorized to use it in the afternoons; John, in particular, must strictly avoid the bin during Alice's allocated time.

Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. When Tom meets Alex in the garden shortly afterwards, he instructs him to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. He also explicitly instructs him to tell Benni to only use A X200R. Alex volunteers to buy several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself and to tell Benni about Tom's instruction. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up.

He explains: \"I have used the fertilizer I previously used; it is called B Y33R!\" Tom remembers that he had filled B Y33R in a green can - long before he had read about the chemicals in his magazine.

If Lily had followed the policy and not used the machine at 9:00 am, only Emma’s load would have been running. The machine broke *immediately* due to being \"overwhelmed by two simultaneous loads,\" implying that the concurrent use (violating the policy) directly caused the breakdown. Without Lily’s simultaneous use, the machine would likely not have failed at that moment, even if it was in poor condition.

Her team consists of two assistants, Lisa and Noah, both of whom have been working with her for a year. Recently, Emma decided it was time to enhance her most popular pastries further after noticing that competitors had started experimenting with new ingredients. She came across information in a culinary journal that recommended using premium butter for richer flavors. Intrigued, she selected a top-quality product called ButterGold and decided it would be their standard ingredient for all baked goods moving forward. One morning, before heading to an important supplier meeting, Emma called Lisa to her office. She asked Lisa to purchase ButterGold immediately and use it for all their pastries. Additionally, she gave Lisa clear instructions to inform Noah about using only ButterGold and not to experiment with any other butter types. Later that same day, Lisa assured Emma she would handle both the purchase and the communication with Noah. Over the next several weeks, Emma started receiving mixed feedback from her customers. While some raved about the incredible improvement in flavor, others complained about an odd aftertaste in certain pastries. Concerned, Emma investigated by directly questioning both Lisa and Noah. Under pressure, Lisa admitted that, despite her assurances, she provided Noah with false instructions. She told him Emma actually wanted them to use a cheaper, subpar butter brand called ButterLow. Her intent was to make Noah look bad in front of Emma, exploiting any customer complaints to strengthen her own position. Throughout this period, Lisa used only ButterGold for her recipes. Noah, on the other hand, unaware of Emma’s real preference, exclusively used ButterLow, following Lisa’s misdirection. After carefully reviewing which pastries had issues, Emma realized the strange aftertaste came from pastries where traces of ButterGold and ButterLow had inadvertently been mixed during preparation.",

While Lisa deceived Noah, his action (using ButterLow) was a necessary component of the causal chain. If Noah had used ButterGold as originally instructed, the mixing (and thus the aftertaste) would not have occurred. Thus, his action satisfies counterfactual dependence for the outcome.",

On the second day of an international biology symposium, Dr. Hayes decided to have lunch with a fellow researcher, Dr. Carter, at the hotel restaurant. Midway through their discussion about genetic advances in coral studies, Dr. Hayes excused herself to take a call outside.

The two bakers organize their tasks independently, and Sarah has never needed to micromanage them because of their professionalism. Wanting to introduce a new premium cupcake line for the upcoming holiday season, she decides to improve the flavor profile. After reading an article in a bakery trade journal, Sarah learns that adding high-quality vanilla extract can significantly enhance sweetness and aroma. The journal highlights two standout brands: Brand V Pure for its balanced flavor and Brand S Premium for its robust notes. However, it also strongly warns that combining extracts from different brands can create an incompatible, bitter flavor. Wanting the best results, Sarah decides to exclusively use Brand V Pure. At the next team meeting, Sarah announces her decision and tasks Emma with purchasing multiple bottles of Brand V Pure for their daily use. A few weeks later, Sarah tastes several batches of cupcakes and is surprised that some taste perfect while others are unpleasantly bitter. Confused and concerned about her new premium line, Sarah speaks separately to Emma and Charlie. Emma assures her that she followed instructions and used only the purchased Brand V Pure extract.

Her car is known for its reliability, always kept well-maintained with regular services. The city's environmental division monitors all vehicles closely during rush hours for emission infractions, and cars emitting heavy smoke are penalized immediately. On a chaotic morning during peak traffic, Jake decided to bring takeout breakfast into the car, something he usually avoids doing. As he unwrapped his meal, a sudden stop caused the container to tip over, spilling sauce onto the seats, leaving a sticky mess. At almost the same time, Lily, half-asleep from staying up late the previous night, accidentally knocked her coffee, which splashed onto the car's floor mats as the vehicle idled at a congested intersection. To add to the disarray, Ethan carelessly placed his large backpack on the dashboard, unintentionally covering the front vents and hindering proper airflow for the car’s cooling system. These combined mishaps led to the vehicle overheating, with smoke billowing out of the exhaust. The city enforcement team flagged Mia's car during their routine emission checks, declaring it temporarily unfit for operation and putting their carpool plan on hold for the day.",

    "response": "Answer (Yes or No?): No\n\n**Explanation**:  \nThe car was banned due to smoke caused by overheating, which directly resulted from Ethan's backpack blocking the vents (hindering airflow). Jake's spilled sauce created a mess but did not contribute to the mechanical overheating or emissions. Under actual causality frameworks (e.g., counterfactual dependence or necessity), Jake's action fails the \"but-for\" test: even if the sauce spill had not occurred, Ethan's blocked vents alone would still have caused overheating and the subsequent ban.

She quickly gathered all the ingredients, measured everything, and popped a tray of chocolate chip cookies into the oven. Later, Clara struggled to experiment with some other recipes, but a batch came out burnt, which made her hesitant to continue. Toward the evening, as she was reorganizing her pantry, Clara found some leftover oats and decided to bake oatmeal raisin cookies before completely closing down her bake-off session for the day.

Anna, stationed at the north end, notices her control panel's green light, signaling to start the conveyor. Mark, at the south end, also sees the same green signal on his panel, unaware that their simultaneous actions could harm the system. Neither is informed in advance about the motor's electrical fault. Acting swiftly and without hesitation, both workers engage their controls at exactly the same time, initiating the system from their respective ends.

Her two assistants, Sarah and Luke, handle different aspects of jam production, from chopping fruits to monitoring the cooking process. Since orders have risen sharply, Emma decides to enhance the production process for durability. Reading a research article on food preservation, she learns that a specific preservative can significantly extend product shelf life. Among the options, the article praises two chemicals: C StabiloMax for its effectiveness and natural flavor preservation, and D SafePreserve for its reliability under extreme temperatures. However, the article warns about dangers, particularly chemical interactions, if both are mixed in one batch. After careful consideration, Emma selects C StabiloMax, favoring its compatibility with her kitchen ethos. While making rounds, she speaks to Sarah and emphasizes the importance of using only C StabiloMax in every single batch. To ensure this directive is followed, she asks Sarah to communicate it to Luke and oversee its implementation. Sarah, appearing cooperative, volunteers to take charge of ordering the preservative for both herself and Luke. However, weeks later, Emma notices anomalies in a few jars stored in the inventory: murky discoloration and a slight chemical odor. When these signs worsen in affected jars, Emma becomes alarmed and begins investigating. Confronting both staff members, Sarah admits to a deception: she had deliberately misinformed Luke, telling him to use D SafePreserve. Her intent had been to create mistakes in Luke's work so that he would lose hours, allowing her to take on additional shifts. Sarah herself used only C StabiloMax in her batches. Luke, meanwhile, had wholeheartedly followed Sarah's instructions, using D SafePreserve without realizing it conflicted with Emma's actual directions. When Emma reviews the spoiled jars, she finds they are all from batches where the two preservatives had been mistakenly combined.",
    "query": "Did Luke cause the spoilage of the jam?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nLuke's use of D SafePreserve, following Sarah's deceptive instructions, directly contributed to the mixing of preservatives (C and D) in the same batches. The spoilage occurred **only** in batches where both chemicals were combined, as warned by the article. If Luke had not added D (counterfactually), the interaction would not have occurred, and the jars would not have spoiled. While Sarah’s deception was the primary manipulative factor, Luke’s action was a necessary component in the causal chain leading to the outcome.

Emma provided a detailed manual, and Lily confidently volunteered to manage the water tank setup while Noah took charge of the coffee bean system. The café had two water tanks, one labeled 'white' and the other 'black,' which were used for different purposes. Lily prepared what she assumed was the 'white' tank, ensuring it was filled with purified water, while Noah worked on his part. Unfortunately, a mix-up occurred when Lily mistakenly referred to the black tank as the white one during their discussion. Following her instructions, Noah added coffee beans into the black tank. This tank, as Emma later remembered, still contained traces of an experimental cleaning solution from a month ago, which had been overlooked after initial tests. Over the next few days, customers began giving split feedback about the coffee—some praising its refined flavor, while others complained of a strange, charred aftertaste. Alarmed, Emma stopped using the machine and investigated the problem. When she revisited both tanks, the issue became clear: Noah had unknowingly allowed the coffee beans to come into contact with the cleaning solution remnants in the black tank. The burnt aftertaste was strongest in coffee brewed from these beans.

Suzy's signal is green, so she is also supposed to drive across immediately. Neither of them realizes that the bridge is on the verge of collapse. If either of them drives their train onto the bridge, it will collapse. Either train is heavy enough on its own to break the bridge. Billy follows his signal and drives his train onto the bridge immediately at the same time that Suzy follows her signal and drives her train onto the bridge. Both trains move onto the bridge at the same time, and at that moment the bridge collapses.",
    "query": "Did Billy cause the bridge to collapse?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation:** Both Billy and Suzy's actions were actual causes of the bridge collapse. While either train alone would have sufficed to collapse the bridge (making their individual actions *sufficient* causes), they acted simultaneously, and their combined presence constitutes an overdetermined causal scenario. In such cases, standard theories of actual causality (e.g., structural equations or counterfactual frameworks) typically classify both actions as causes because each was a necessary part of the actual set of events that jointly led to the outcome. Even though the collapse would have occurred if either acted alone, the fact that both acted *together* in reality means neither is excluded as a cause.",

He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him.

Her two assistants, Sarah and Luke, handle different aspects of jam production, from chopping fruits to monitoring the cooking process. Since orders have risen sharply, Emma decides to enhance the production process for durability. Reading a research article on food preservation, she learns that a specific preservative can significantly extend product shelf life. Among the options, the article praises two chemicals: C StabiloMax for its effectiveness and natural flavor preservation, and D SafePreserve for its reliability under extreme temperatures. However, the article warns about dangers, particularly chemical interactions, if both are mixed in one batch. After careful consideration, Emma selects C StabiloMax, favoring its compatibility with her kitchen ethos. While making rounds, she speaks to Sarah and emphasizes the importance of using only C StabiloMax in every single batch. To ensure this directive is followed, she asks Sarah to communicate it to Luke and oversee its implementation.

Emma's crane is positioned to lift a beam onto the northern end, while Jake's crane targets the southern end. Emma's control panel displays a red warning signal due to a reported instability in the structure, prompting her to halt operations temporarily. Jake's control panel, showing no warnings, signals him to proceed as planned and place his beam. Unaware of the structural instability, Jake follows the prompt and begins placing the beam. Meanwhile, Emma, deciding to disregard the warning for fear of delaying the project, also moves her beam into place. Within seconds of both beams being placed simultaneously, the unstable structure fails and collapses entirely.",

Rebecca, an artist who loved painting sunsets that Anthony described to her, met her husband at a workshop promoting accessibility in the arts. They married soon after, supported by a close-knit community. On one autumn evening, Anthony booked a ride-sharing service to attend the premiere of Rebecca’s latest art exhibition at the local gallery. The couple's guide dogs, Amber and Scout, sat calmly beside them as they waited for the car. When the driver arrived and noticed the dogs, he grew visibly irritated and claimed his vehicle would be ruined by pet hair, refusing the fare. Left without a ride and with time running out, Rebecca and Anthony decided to walk the two miles into town. Their route took them along an old boardwalk and over a pier extending over the bay. Earlier that day, a fishing crew had reported that high tides had damaged parts of the pier, but the warnings were not acted upon in time. Under the dim streetlights, Rebecca and Anthony approached the pier, unaware of its dangerous condition. Around 10 minutes earlier, part of the pier had collapsed into the water. The driver, unaware of the recent collapse, had walked that route an hour earlier and reached the other side safely before returning to his car. Tragically, as Rebecca and Anthony made their way across, they stepped unknowingly onto the weakened section, falling into the cold, choppy water below. Despite their guide dogs' barking for help, the couple drowned, and their bodies were discovered the next morning.",

This system relies on two components: a motion detector that monitors movement in the exhibit room and a door sensor that detects when the exhibit room door is opened. The security protocol is programmed to trigger an alarm only if both the motion detector and door sensor are activated at the same time, as this combination suggests a potential breach. The motion detector is designed to tolerate occasional movement from small animals or environmental factors, while the door sensor should remain inactive unless deliberately triggered by authorized personnel. However, during a routine cleaning session, both the motion detector detects sudden movement, and the door sensor is accidentally activated simultaneously. As a result, the alarm sounds, creating a false alert.",

In this scenario, the door sensor's activation was a necessary component of the causal chain:  \n- If the door sensor had **not** been accidentally activated (all else unchanged), the alarm would **not** have sounded.  \n- Thus, the door sensor's activation satisfies counterfactual dependence, a key criterion for actual causality.

Today, however, things unfolded differently: the east wing family followed their usual schedule, running their taps right at 6:30 am. Unexpectedly, the west wing family also started their water usage at the same time, as they were preparing for a local farmer's market that required an early head start. This coincidental overlap caused the water heating system to activate promptly at 6:30 am, meeting the demand of both families simultaneously.",

In the usual scenario, the east wing family alone uses water at 6:30 am, and the system activates at that time. This implies their individual demand is sufficient to trigger the system. Today, even though the west wing family coincidentally used water simultaneously, the east wing’s actions alone would still meet the threshold for activation. Since the system would have activated at 6:30 am due to the first household’s routine regardless of the second household’s overlap, the first household is a cause of the activation.

Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. Tom instructs Alex and Benni to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. Alex volunteers for buying several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up. That makes Tom very sad and reflective. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. Alex tells him that he followed Tom's instruction: \"I only bought and used the chemical A X200R which I had funneled into the blue can.\" Benni suddenly is startled and says to Alex: \"What?

Then I am sorry!\" Tom remembers that he had filled B Y33R in a green can - long before he had read about the chemicals in his magazine. He had never used it. So Benni must have accidentally, without knowing it, applied the chemical B Y33R, whereas only Alex applied A X200R.

With both approvals finalized, Dr. Karen secured the much-needed diagnostic equipment for her clinic.",
    "query": "Does the regional financing committee cause the approval of Dr. Karen's application?",
    "response": "Answer: No.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nIn the given scenario, approval from either the healthcare equipment board or the regional financing committee was sufficient for Dr. Karen to secure the diagnostic tools. While both entities approved her application, the outcome (securing the equipment) would have occurred even if only one had approved. Under a counterfactual analysis—where we ask if the outcome would *not* have occurred if the regional financing committee had *not* approved—the answer is **no**, because the healthcare board’s approval alone would still have sufficed. Thus, the regional financing committee’s approval was not a necessary cause of the outcome in this specific case. While frameworks like Halpern and Pearl’s structural model might classify both approvals as causes due to overdetermination, the question likely hinges on necessity, leading to the conclusion that the regional committee’s approval was not a cause.",

Her two assistants, Sarah and Luke, handle different aspects of jam production, from chopping fruits to monitoring the cooking process. Since orders have risen sharply, Emma decides to enhance the production process for durability. Reading a research article on food preservation, she learns that a specific preservative can significantly extend product shelf life. Among the options, the article praises two chemicals: C StabiloMax for its effectiveness and natural flavor preservation, and D SafePreserve for its reliability under extreme temperatures. However, the article warns about dangers, particularly chemical interactions, if both are mixed in one batch. After careful consideration, Emma selects C StabiloMax, favoring its compatibility with her kitchen ethos. While making rounds, she speaks to Sarah and emphasizes the importance of using only C StabiloMax in every single batch. To ensure this directive is followed, she asks Sarah to communicate it to Luke and oversee its implementation. Sarah, appearing cooperative, volunteers to take charge of ordering the preservative for both herself and Luke. However, weeks later, Emma notices anomalies in a few jars stored in the inventory: murky discoloration and a slight chemical odor. When these signs worsen in affected jars, Emma becomes alarmed and begins investigating. Confronting both staff members, Sarah admits to a deception: she had deliberately misinformed Luke, telling him to use D SafePreserve. Her intent had been to create mistakes in Luke's work so that he would lose hours, allowing her to take on additional shifts. Sarah herself used only C StabiloMax in her batches. Luke, meanwhile, had wholeheartedly followed Sarah's instructions, using D SafePreserve without realizing it conflicted with Emma's actual directions.

On the front desk, there is a brightly colored candy jar designated specifically for rewarding children who join the library’s reading program. A clear sign near the jar states emphatically: 'For kids in the reading program only!' Earlier in the day, the librarian had reminded the staff not to take any candies themselves. However, during a brief lull in the afternoon, a library staff member quietly takes a candy, thinking no one would notice. Later, a regular library patron, having witnessed this, assumes it’s acceptable and also grabs a candy despite not being eligible. By closing time, every piece of candy has disappeared. That night, as a child approaches the desk with excitement, ready to receive a candy for completing their first book in the program, their joy turns to disappointment upon finding the jar completely empty.",
    "query": "Did the patron cause the problem?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes  \n**Explanation**: The patron's action directly contributed to the depletion of the candies. While the staff member initiated the unauthorized taking, the patron’s decision to take a candy (despite ineligibility) further reduced the supply. If the patron had not taken a candy, there might have been at least one remaining for the child. Thus, the patron’s action was a necessary part of the causal chain leading to the empty jar and the child’s disappointment.",

Using counterfactual reasoning: If Jerry had *not* pressed the button, the TV would have remained on without restarting. Since his action was necessary and sufficient for the restart under the given conditions (TV already on), Jerry is the actual cause of the restart.

Recently, she identified the pressing need for a state-of-the-art ultrasound machine to help diagnose her patients more effectively. Within her hospital, any purchase exceeding a certain budget threshold requires approval from two decision-making groups: the equipment procurement committee and the financial oversight board. These groups function independently, with neither being required to consult the other during deliberations. Approval from just one of these groups is enough to authorize the requested purchase. The equipment procurement committee has a reputation for being supportive of such requests and generally has a high approval rate. On the other hand, the financial oversight board takes a much stricter approach, often rejecting proposals regardless of their merit, given their focus on keeping expenditures to a minimum. Despite knowing this, Dr. Bennett submits her request to both groups. On the set date when both groups hold their respective meetings, the equipment procurement committee makes the expected decision to approve her request. To her surprise, the financial oversight board also gives its approval, a rare occurrence. As a result, Dr. Bennett is granted permission to purchase the ultrasound machine, significantly benefiting her patients.",

The equipment procurement committee (which typically approves requests) granted approval, meaning the request would have been authorized *even if the financial oversight board had rejected it*. Since the financial oversight board’s approval was not necessary for the outcome (the request’s approval), it does not qualify as a cause under standard definitions of actual causality (e.g., counterfactual dependence is not satisfied).

A team of colleagues who gained access to the leaked rankings decided to exploit this information to improve their chances. However, Sarah Blake, a member of the team, opposed this decision and refused to participate, understanding the potential harm of using such information. By the competition’s close, the company had allocated a $10,000 maximum bonus to the top 10 performers, a $5,000 standard bonus to the next 10, and smaller bonuses to others. Blake’s results placed her as the 10th-ranked employee, narrowly qualifying her for the maximum bonus. Meanwhile, the employee in 11th place, who had been saving for rehabilitation therapy costs following a major medical procedure, missed the cutoff for the maximum bonus and received only the standard one, leaving her $200 short of her required funds.",
    "query": "Did Blake cause the 11th performer to miss the medical treatment savings target?",
    "response": "Answer: No.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nAccording to the counterfactual theory of causation, Blake’s actions (refusing to exploit the leaked rankings) did not directly cause the 11th performer to miss the savings target. If Blake had participated in cheating, her rank might have improved (e.g., moving higher than 10th), but this would not have changed the 11th performer’s position. Conversely, Blake’s legitimate performance placed her fairly at 10th, which is independent of the 11th performer’s rank. The outcome hinges on the competition’s cutoff rules and the actions of others who exploited the leak, not Blake’s ethical refusal. Thus, Blake’s behavior was not a necessary factor in the 11th performer’s failure to reach the bonus threshold.",

Part of his role involves checking books left on tables or misplaced by visitors and returning them to their rightful places promptly. Sarah, another librarian in the library's operations team, works mainly with managing membership registrations and assisting new visitors. Despite her different role, Sarah is also trained to locate where all books belong and can take over reshelving duties when needed, especially if John is unavailable or forgets. However, on July 3rd, a particularly busy day due to a local book festival, John neglected to address a pile of books left unshelved.

Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. When Tom meets Alex in the garden shortly afterwards, he instructs him to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. He also explicitly instructs him to tell Benni to only use A X200R. Alex volunteers to buy several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself and to tell Benni about Tom's instruction. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up. That makes Tom very sad and reflective. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. Alex immediately starts apologizing: \"I am sorry! I completely forgot to tell Benni about the rule! I bought and used the chemical A X200R but Benni must have used something else because he did not know about the new rule.\" Benni tells Tom that Alex had not told him that they were only supposed to use A X200R. He explains: \"I have used the fertilizer I previously used; it is called B Y33R!\" Tom remembers that he had filled B Y33R in a green can - long before he had read about the chemicals in his magazine. He had never used it. So Benni must have accidentally, without knowing it, applied the chemical B Y33R, whereas only Alex applied A X200R.

To minimize the risk of system conflicts, strict schedules dictate access—Rachel is authorized to use the vault exclusively in the mornings, and Thomas is assigned the afternoons. One busy day, Thomas, aware of the schedule but pressed by an urgent task, accesses the secure vault at 10 am. Meanwhile, Rachel is also accessing the vault at the same time for her routine work.

Taking this advice seriously, Lucy decided to standardize her recipes and use only Icing Mix C for all cake decorations moving forward. A day later, while reviewing the bakery’s inventory, Lucy explained her decision to Emma. She instructed Emma to purchase an adequate stock of Icing Mix C and explicitly informed her to ensure that Jack also uses only Icing Mix C. Emma, eager to take control of the situation, assured Lucy she would handle everything. Over the next few weeks, Lucy began receiving mixed feedback from her customers—some praised her cakes for their exceptional quality, while others complained about an odd bitter aftertaste. Confused by these contradictory remarks, Lucy decided to investigate. After some persistent questioning, Emma reluctantly admitted that she had instructed Jack to use only Icing Mix D instead of Icing Mix C. Her intention was to make Jack's cakes fail so that she could have more control over cake decoration and possibly earn more recognition from Lucy. However, Emma herself followed Lucy’s instructions and used only Icing Mix C. Jack, unaware of this deception, trusted Emma's instructions and exclusively used Icing Mix D for his work. Upon analyzing the feedback and inspecting the ruined cakes, Lucy realized that they were batches that had been partially iced with Icing Mix C by Emma and Icing Mix D by Jack, causing the undesirable textures and flavors.",
    "query": "Did the icing used by Jack cause the cakes to be ruined?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe cakes were ruined due to the combination of Icing Mix C (used by Emma) and Icing Mix D (used by Jack), which the judges explicitly warned against. Jack’s use of Icing Mix D was a necessary factor in creating this harmful mixture. If Jack had adhered to Lucy’s original instruction (using only Icing Mix C), the incompatible combination would not have occurred, and the cakes would not have been ruined. Thus, Jack’s action directly contributed to the causal chain leading to the undesirable outcome.",

Their task for the day is to handle enormous steel beams that need to be carefully placed onto specific sections of the site. Nearby, a fragile scaffolding structure is under repair but has no warning signs indicating its poor condition. Each crane operator relies on signal lights to coordinate their actions. Anna's signal turns green, telling her to lower a beam onto the scaffolding without delay. Simultaneously, Mike's signal also flashes green, directing him to do the exact same thing. Unaware of any potential risk, both operators trust their signals and proceed to lower their beams. The scaffolding, unable to handle the combined load of the two beams, gives way and collapses.",

She has two skilled assistants, Sarah and Emma, who share her passion for creating delicious baked goods. Lisa recently attended a baking workshop where she learned that butter and margarine are both excellent ingredients for achieving moist cakes when used individually. However, during the workshop, the instructor emphasized that combining butter and margarine in the same batter could lead to a baking failure, such as dense and unappealing cakes. Taking this advice to heart, Lisa decides to only use butter moving forward and instructs Sarah and Emma to strictly adhere to this one-ingredient policy. To ensure things run smoothly, Sarah takes charge of purchasing all the required baking supplies and stocks the kitchen with high-quality butter. A few weeks later, Lisa notices that some of their cakes are receiving complaints from customers for being unusually flat and heavy. Alarmed, Lisa reviews the baking logs and questions her team. Sarah confirms that she followed the instruction of using only butter in every batter. However, Emma hesitantly confesses that she used a leftover supply of margarine stored at her home, wanting to avoid waste. Upon inspecting the affected recipes, Lisa uncovers that the dense cakes came from batches where both butter and margarine were unknowingly combined in the same batter, contradicting the guidelines given at the workshop.",

    "response": "Answer: No.\n\nExplanation: The dense cakes were caused by the combination of butter and margarine in the same batter, as warned by the workshop. While Sarah used butter as instructed, the failure occurred because Emma independently added margarine to the same batches. Sarah’s use of butter alone was not the causal factor—it was the interaction between butter (Sarah’s contribution) and margarine (Emma’s contribution) that violated the policy and produced the dense texture.

Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. Tom instructs Alex and Benni to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. Alex volunteers for buying several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up. That makes Tom very sad and reflective.

When all the team scores were tallied, Anna and Jake won the $100 prize and celebrated by splitting it evenly as they had agreed. If you think about the different outcomes, imagine: What if Anna hadn’t buzzed in and answered her bonus question correctly during the first round? Or what if Jake hadn’t scored the bonus points in the final round?",
    "query": "Did Anna and Jake win the $100 prize because Anna answered the bonus question correctly?",
    "response": "Answer: No.\n\n**Explanation:** The $100 prize required at least one correct bonus answer from the team. While Anna’s correct answer contributed to their victory, Jake’s correct answer in the final round also sufficed to meet the prize condition. Using a counterfactual test: *If Anna had not answered correctly*, Jake’s answer alone would still have secured the prize. Since the outcome (winning) would have occurred even without Anna’s action, her answer is not a necessary cause under standard counterfactual reasoning. Both actions are sufficient but not individually necessary in this overdetermined scenario.",

Valve A is part of the main operational circuit, intended to manage daily water flow. Valve B, on the other hand, serves as an emergency bypass valve that should remain shut to prevent mixing excess water into the system. Under normal circumstances, if just one valve is open, the tank functions properly without incident. One morning, during a routine inspection, both Valve A and Valve B are mistakenly left open for hours, allowing water from two separate sources to flow into the tank concurrently. As a result, the tank exceeds its capacity and floods the greenhouse floor, causing damage.",
    "query": "Did the fact that Valve A was open cause the system to overflow?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe system overflowed because both valves were open simultaneously. The story specifies that under normal circumstances, opening **either valve alone** does not cause an overflow. However, the concurrent opening of **both** valves led to excess water flow. To assess actual causality:  \n\n- **Counterfactual test:** If Valve A had been closed (while Valve B remained open), the tank would not have overflowed (as one open valve is deemed safe). Thus, Valve A’s openness is a **necessary condition** for the overflow in this specific scenario.  \n\nSince the overflow depends on the **combined action** of both valves, Valve A’s openness qualifies as a cause.",

This issue could impact the accuracy of the flight's routing but might be resolved using a troubleshooting procedure the pilot recently learned about during a training session. However, the pilot cannot act independently. Approval must first be obtained from the maintenance chief, who ensures that the procedure is safe for the plane, and the air traffic controller, who verifies compliance with aviation protocols and regulations. The pilot forwards a request to both parties. The maintenance chief promptly reviews the request, sees no risks, and grants approval without hesitation. Meanwhile, the air traffic controller carefully assesses the situation and notices serious regulatory concerns. The procedure, while effective in many cases, can occasionally disrupt radio communications, which violates strict aviation safety policies. Despite these risks, the air traffic controller decides to approve the request, believing the situation is urgent enough to justify the potential side effects.

As days passed, the ship veered slightly off track, ultimately running aground on an unexpected sandbar.",
    "query": "Did Sarah not adjusting the course system cause the ship to run aground?",
    "response": "Answer (Yes or No?): No  \n\n**Explanation**:  \nThe ship running aground was directly caused by Captain Tom’s failure to program the navigation system, as this was his explicit responsibility. While Sarah had the technical ability to adjust the course, her role did not obligate her to do so, even if Tom neglected his duty. In causal judgment frameworks, omissions are typically considered causes only if there was a *duty to act*. Since Sarah had no such duty, her inaction does not qualify as an actual cause. The primary and sufficient cause remains Tom’s failure to fulfill his role.",

Sara and Paul, playing together for the first time, are up against a pair known for their aggressive style. Sara, stationed at the baseline to return serves, is watching the opponents carefully. During a heated rally, she notices one opponent setting up for a strong smash directed down the center of the court. Meanwhile, Paul, focused on intercepting short volleys near the net, steps further toward the front. The rules ban verbal communication during rallies, so Sara stays silent and does not alert Paul about the imminent smash. Moments later, the ball from the smash rockets toward Paul and hits him before he can react. He sustains an injury, and their team is forced to withdraw from the match, ending their championship run.",

In this assessment, she needs to excel in two areas: answering a set of questions and submitting a creative portfolio for evaluation. Success in the assessment depends on her performance in this attempt alone. The job criteria specify that Maria will pass as long as her test score exceeds 50 or if her portfolio is judged as exceptional by the evaluation team. Given the simplicity of the test questions, it is highly likely that she will score more than 50. Moreover, her portfolio submissions usually receive high praise. During the assessment, Maria simultaneously answers all the questions and uploads her portfolio. As predicted, she easily scores 95 on the test, and her portfolio is also deemed exceptional. Consequently, Maria passes the assessment.",

    "response": "Answer: No.\n\n**Explanation**: Maria's passing the assessment is determined by either a test score over 50 or an exceptional portfolio. Since her test score (95) alone sufficed for passing, the portfolio—though exceptional—was not a necessary cause. Actual causality requires that the outcome would not have occurred *but for* the candidate cause. Here, Maria would have passed even without the portfolio, so it did not result in her success.",

Given that the account is always logged in on their TV, the streaming service will suspend their account if three people log into the account from their laptops at the same time. Anne regularly uses their account from her laptop on Saturdays. Todd, however, normally doesn't watch TV at all on the weekends. This Saturday, unexpectedly, Todd logged into their account from his laptop to watch TV.

Over time, as the demand for her cakes increased significantly, she decided to hire two assistants, Emma and Jack, to manage the workload. Jack specializes in baking the cakes while Emma focuses on decorating them. They jointly discuss how to coordinate their schedules and divide responsibilities. Both employees have proven themselves to be diligent workers, which makes Lucy proud of her team. However, Lucy has been aiming to further improve the taste and presentation of her cakes to elevate the bakery’s reputation. During a pastry competition she recently attended, Lucy learned that the type of icing directly influences both the flavor and appearance of the cakes. Professional judges at the competition recommended using either Icing Mix C for its rich taste or Icing Mix D for its aesthetic shine. However, they also issued a stern warning: mixing different icing types on the same batch of cakes can completely ruin both the flavor and texture. Taking this advice seriously, Lucy decided to standardize her recipes and use only Icing Mix C for all cake decorations moving forward. A day later, while reviewing the bakery’s inventory, Lucy explained her decision to Emma. She instructed Emma to purchase an adequate stock of Icing Mix C and explicitly informed her to ensure that Jack also uses only Icing Mix C. Emma, eager to take control of the situation, assured Lucy she would handle everything. Over the next few weeks, Lucy began receiving mixed feedback from her customers—some praised her cakes for their exceptional quality, while others complained about an odd bitter aftertaste. Confused by these contradictory remarks, Lucy decided to investigate. After some persistent questioning, Emma reluctantly admitted that she had instructed Jack to use only Icing Mix D instead of Icing Mix C. Her intention was to make Jack's cakes fail so that she could have more control over cake decoration and possibly earn more recognition from Lucy. However, Emma herself followed Lucy’s instructions and used only Icing Mix C. Jack, unaware of this deception, trusted Emma's instructions and exclusively used Icing Mix D for his work. Upon analyzing the feedback and inspecting the ruined cakes, Lucy realized that they were batches that had been partially iced with Icing Mix C by Emma and Icing Mix D by Jack, causing the undesirable textures and flavors.",
    "query": "Did Emma cause the cakes to be ruined?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes  \n**Explanation**: Emma's deliberate instruction to Jack to use Icing Mix D (contrary to Lucy’s explicit order) directly led to the mixing of icings C and D on the same batches. This mixing violated the judges’ warning and caused the ruined textures and flavors. While Emma followed Lucy’s instructions herself, her deceptive action toward Jack was a necessary and critical factor in the outcome.

To win the competition, Jamie’s dish must meet two criteria: it needs to score higher than 8 from the taste panel, and it also requires the unanimous approval of the three judges overseeing the event. While achieving a score higher than 8 is almost unheard of in the competition's history, the judges are known for aligning their opinions if a dish truly stands out. Jamie plates their dish with painstaking precision and submits it for judging, awaiting the results nervously. Moments later, the results are announced—the dish receives unanimous approval from the judges and earns an astounding score of 9, exceeding expectations. Jamie is declared the winner of the competition.",
    "query": "Did Jamie win because of the unanimous approval?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation:**  \nTo win, Jamie needed **both** a score >8 **and** unanimous approval. While the high score was remarkable, the unanimous approval was also a necessary condition. If approval had not occurred (even with a score of 9), Jamie would not have won. Thus, the unanimous approval is an actual cause of the victory because it was a required factor in the outcome.",

In addition to keeping the account constantly logged in on their TV, they also use the same account on their laptops. Because the provider of this streaming service wants to increase the amount of active accounts in order to increase profits, they have begun to monitor the number of devices using a single account at once. Given that the account is always logged in on their TV, the streaming service will suspend their account if three people log into the account from their laptops at the same time. Anne regularly uses their account from her laptop on Saturdays. Todd, however, normally doesn't watch TV at all on the weekends. This Saturday, unexpectedly, Todd logged into their account from his laptop to watch TV. Just then, Anne also logged into their account from her laptop, and Jason also logged into their account from his laptop to watch TV.

Despite his busy schedule managing the kitchen staff, he is meticulous about tasting and seasoning each soup personally. Lisa, on the other hand, is a senior server who has been working at the restaurant for several years. While she is skilled in customer service and understands the basics of cooking, her duties do not involve preparing or seasoning food unless explicitly asked. One busy evening, during a rush with many orders, Paul became distracted and forgot to add the final seasoning to the lobster bisque, one of the restaurant's signature dishes. Lisa noticed the soup was ready to serve but assumed Paul had already seasoned it, even though she is familiar with how to finalize the soup herself. The lobster bisque was served to diners, who later complained that it lacked flavor and was disappointing for the restaurant's reputation.",

Paul, as the chef, had the explicit duty to season the soup. His failure to do so was both necessary and sufficient for the soup tasting bad. Lisa’s role did not include seasoning unless instructed, so her inaction was consistent with her responsibilities and not a deviation. While she *could* have intervened, her lack of action is not considered a cause in this context because it was not her obligation to ensure proper seasoning.

She regularly works with two talented artists, Emma and Jack, assigning them the task of painting various canvases. Lisa emphasizes artistic freedom, allowing Emma and Jack to determine how to divide their workload. Both have earned her trust by producing consistent, quality work. To ensure the durability of the paintings, Lisa recently decided to apply protective varnish over completed works. After researching, she discovered that two popular varnishes, V ProGloss and V SatinShield, could offer exceptional results. However, mixing the two can lead to severe degradation of the artwork, such as cracks forming on the paint. Lisa resolved to use only V ProGloss and decided to communicate this to her artists. One morning, Lisa discussed her plan with Emma, who was busy preparing brushes at the studio. She gave Emma clear instructions: purchase V ProGloss for both herself and Jack and ensure Jack also exclusively uses it. Emma agreed, offering to save time by buying enough varnish for them both. Several weeks later, while examining the paintings in the gallery, Lisa was thrilled by a few vibrant, polished pieces but became distressed upon finding several canvases with dull, cracked surfaces. Devastated, she investigated by questioning both artists. Emma reluctantly admitted she had told Jack to use V SatinShield instead, intending to sabotage Jack’s works and make her own stand out. Although she only varnished her paintings with V ProGloss, Emma knowingly caused Jack to use the unsuitable V SatinShield. Jack, unaware of Lisa’s original instructions, explained he had used V SatinShield exclusively due to Emma’s misleading directive. Lisa realized the cracked canvases were a result of overlapping applications of both varnishes—V ProGloss and V SatinShield—on the same pieces.",

    "response": "Answer: Yes\n\n**Explanation:**  \nEmma's varnishing directly contributed to the cracking of the paintings. While she used V ProGloss on her own works, her intentional sabotage caused Jack to use V SatinShield. The degradation occurred when both varnishes were applied to the same canvases (e.g., overlapping applications). Emma’s actions—both her use of V ProGloss *and* her deceitful instruction to Jack—created the necessary conditions for the harmful mixture.

However, during the workshop, the instructor emphasized that combining butter and margarine in the same batter could lead to a baking failure, such as dense and unappealing cakes. Taking this advice to heart, Lisa decides to only use butter moving forward and instructs Sarah and Emma to strictly adhere to this one-ingredient policy. To ensure things run smoothly, Sarah takes charge of purchasing all the required baking supplies and stocks the kitchen with high-quality butter. A few weeks later, Lisa notices that some of their cakes are receiving complaints from customers for being unusually flat and heavy. Alarmed, Lisa reviews the baking logs and questions her team. Sarah confirms that she followed the instruction of using only butter in every batter. However, Emma hesitantly confesses that she used a leftover supply of margarine stored at her home, wanting to avoid waste.

He is the staff member in charge of the computer lab, which contains dozens of devices used by students daily for various activities. One of his main duties is ensuring that all the computers have their antivirus software updated and functioning efficiently. Sarah, a biology teacher at the school, is also proficient at managing software and sometimes helps her colleagues with technical issues, though her primary role does not involve maintaining the computer lab. If James forgets to update the antivirus software, no formal rule requires Sarah to step in and handle it. On a busy day, when James was organizing a school-wide tech showcase, he forgot to update the antivirus software on several computers, realizing the oversight later but opting not to act on it immediately due to time constraints. Meanwhile, Sarah, preoccupied with preparing a high-profile science exhibition for her students, neither noticed the lapse nor updated the software. A few days later, one of the computers, widely used by students, became infected with a virus, disrupting classroom activities for hours.",
    "query": "Did James not updating the antivirus software cause the computer to get infected with a virus?",
    "response": "Answer (Yes or No?): Yes  \n**Explanation**: James's failure to update the antivirus software directly satisfies the \"but-for\" test for actual causality: if he had performed his duty, the infection would likely have been prevented. His role as the responsible agent for maintaining the lab’s security makes his inaction the critical factor. While Sarah’s inaction contributed to the outcome, her lack of formal responsibility means her role is not causally salient in this context.",

    "story": "Linda owns a small but bustling coffee shop in the heart of the city. She employs two seasoned baristas, Sarah and Mike, who help her run daily operations. The shop prides itself on carefully crafted drinks and a loyal customer base. Wanting to stay ahead of competitors, Linda decides to improve her drinks by introducing a premium syrup called GoldSweet, which she learns from a supplier enhances flavor while preserving the integrity of the coffee blend. However, the supplier also warns her that mixing it with different syrups, such as the store's older ClassicSweet syrup, could create unpleasant, unpredictable flavors. Determined to avoid such mishaps, Linda requests Sarah to oversee the transition to GoldSweet. During a conversation before the morning rush, Linda asks Sarah to purchase enough GoldSweet for the shop and make sure that Mike is also informed to exclusively use it. Sarah agrees and promises to handle both tasks. Over time, Linda notices a divided response from her patrons—some rave about the great taste of the premium drinks, while others complain about some beverages being oddly bitter or off-tasting. Perplexed, Linda decides to investigate by talking to Sarah and Mike. Sarah admits that she might have forgotten to inform Mike about using only GoldSweet. \"I've been using GoldSweet like you asked,\" Sarah explains, \"but I forgot to tell Mike. He must have been using the old syrup, ClassicSweet.\" When Linda confronts Mike, he confirms her suspicion, saying, \"I didn’t know we switched syrups. I’ve been using the yellow bottle of ClassicSweet we’ve had from before.\" Linda realizes that in some drinks, both syrups had inadvertently been used, creating the unpleasant flavors that left many customers dissatisfied.",
    "query": "Did the use of GoldSweet by Sarah cause the drinks to have strange flavors?",
    "response": "Answer (Yes or No?): No\n\n**Explanation**:  \nWhile Sarah’s use of GoldSweet was part of the *context* that led to the problem, the **actual cause** of the strange flavors was the **mixing** of GoldSweet and ClassicSweet in the same drinks. The key causal factor was Sarah’s **failure to inform Mike** to stop using ClassicSweet, which directly led to the unintended combination. If Sarah had not used GoldSweet (but still failed to inform Mike), Mike’s ClassicSweet alone would not have caused the issue. Conversely, if she had properly informed Mike (even while using GoldSweet herself), the mixing would not have occurred. Thus, Sarah’s *action* of using GoldSweet was not the cause; the cause was her *omission* (not informing Mike) paired with Mike’s continued use of ClassicSweet.",

To meet special customer requests, both chefs occasionally need to use the exclusive high-temperature oven located in the main preparation area. Despite thorough training, it remains undiscovered that using the oven simultaneously leads to overheating, triggering the restaurant's sensitive fire alarm system. To prevent such incidents, the restaurant has a strict schedule: Mark can use the oven only during lunchtime, while Joanna is permitted access only for dinner service. However, on a busy Saturday, ignoring the schedule, Joanna uses the oven at 12 pm to fulfill a VIP luncheon order.

The security protocol is programmed to trigger an alarm only if both the motion detector and door sensor are activated at the same time, as this combination suggests a potential breach. The motion detector is designed to tolerate occasional movement from small animals or environmental factors, while the door sensor should remain inactive unless deliberately triggered by authorized personnel. However, during a routine cleaning session, both the motion detector detects sudden movement, and the door sensor is accidentally activated simultaneously. As a result, the alarm sounds, creating a false alert.",

    "story": "David worked as a senior technician responsible for supervising delicate assembly lines at an electronics factory. One of the lesser-known aspects of his life was that he had a rare condition called Hentler's anomaly, which rendered his body incapable of breaking down sulfites commonly found in certain preservatives. If consumed, these compounds could trigger a deadly reaction. At the end of a particularly successful month, the factory celebrated breaking a long-standing production record, and to mark the occasion, the manager, Mr. Robbins, arranged a dinner at a high-end Italian restaurant. Preferring to surprise his team with curated choices, Mr. Robbins decided he would order for everyone. Since Shrimp Scampi was a popular item on the menu, he opted for that for David, even though he briefly considered the Chicken Marsala first. Both items, however, unknowingly contained a white wine sauce—a key source of sulfites. David initially enjoyed the meal with delight, chatting with his coworkers, but shortly afterward, his condition began to deteriorate rapidly. Complaining about dizziness and nausea, he collapsed before reaching the hospital, where the medics confirmed his death.",
    "query": "Did Mr. Robbins' choice of dish cause David's death?",
    "response": "Answer: Yes.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nMr. Robbins' choice of dish directly caused David's death because he selected a meal containing white wine sauce, a source of sulfites. While both considered dishes (Shrimp Scampi and Chicken Marsala) contained sulfites, the act of choosing *any* sulfite-containing dish was necessary for the outcome. Under actual causality frameworks like the NESS test, Robbins' action was part of a sufficient set of conditions leading to the harm. Even though the alternative dish would also have been fatal, the specific choice made (Shrimp Scampi) was still a factual cause in the actual chain of events. The critical factor is that Robbins’ decision to order a sulfite-containing dish—regardless of which one—was essential to the outcome. Thus, his choice qualifies as a cause.",

The restaurant has two kitchens, one for baking and one for cooking meals, and both chefs usually stay in their respective areas. However, the restaurant has only a single high-capacity oven located in the baking kitchen. To ensure smooth operations and avoid chaos, the restaurant enforces a strict schedule for oven usage: Emma is only allowed to bake in the mornings, while Liam can access the oven solely in the evenings. What nobody knows is that a sensor attached to the oven's control system malfunctions when two users operate it at the same time, instantly triggering the restaurant's fire alarm. One busy morning, contrary to the established rules, Liam enters the baking kitchen at 9 am, eager to prepare a special dish that requires baking. Following protocol, Emma begins her usual morning baking routine at 9.30 am, unaware that Liam is already using the oven. This overlap activates the faulty sensor, and the fire alarm blares throughout the restaurant.",

    "story": "Jason was wandering through a bustling farmer's market on a sunny Saturday morning. He stopped by one stall, which displayed a single, gleaming salmon on ice with a handwritten sign that read, 'Wild-Caught, Last One.' The vendor explained that the salmon was fresh from a nearby river and had been a best-seller all day. Jason, who was thinking about an upcoming dinner with his wife, Anna, wanted the salmon but balked at the hefty price tag. When the vendor walked away to speak with another customer, Jason took the opportunity to slyly place the salmon in his reusable bag and quickly left the market, heart pounding. Meanwhile, Anna, inspired by a recipe she recently saw in her favorite cooking magazine, was on a mission to prepare an extravagant welcome-home meal. She had decided that fresh salmon would be the star ingredient. She headed to her local grocery store that afternoon and bought a fresh fillet of salmon. That evening, back at home, Jason unpacked his bag and revealed the salmon he had taken, just as Anna placed hers on the counter. Together, they realized they now had everything needed to create a spectacular dinner for two.",

Jason's stolen salmon alone sufficed as the required ingredient for the dinner. Anna's purchase was redundant because even if she had not bought her fillet, Jason's salmon would still have fulfilled the need.

To move forward with her latest initiative aimed at developing more efficient solar panels, Dr. Carter must submit her project proposal to two critical review panels: the environmental impact panel, which evaluates the ecological sustainability of the project, and the funding allocation panel, which determines its financial feasibility. Interestingly, within the agency, the environmental impact panel has a strong reputation for supporting almost all proposals, as their primary goal is to promote eco-friendly projects. In contrast, the funding allocation panel is notoriously stringent, turning down the vast majority of requests to focus on budget limitations. With a mixture of hope and doubt, Dr. Carter submits her proposal to both panels. Each panel works in complete isolation to avoid bias, and their assessments occur simultaneously. When the decision day arrives, the environmental impact panel readily approves Dr. Carter's proposal, as expected. Unexpectedly, the funding allocation panel, despite their typical behavior, also grants approval to her project. With both panels' green lights, Dr. Carter's ambitious solar panel project officially receives agency approval.",

He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack).

However, his **premature death** (occurring even earlier) was directly caused by the nurse's medication error, an independent, intervening event. While the job change created the conditions for his hospital visit, the proximate cause of his immediate death was the nurse's mistake, which supersedes the prior causal chain in terms of actual causation for the specific timing of his death.

    "response": "Answer (Yes or No?): No  \n\n**Explanation:**  \nWhile Jack's use of V SatinShield was a necessary condition for the cracks (as mixing the varnishes caused degradation), the *actual cause* of the harm lies in Emma’s intentional deception. Jack acted under Emma’s misleading instructions, unaware of Lisa’s directive to use only V ProGloss. In causal judgment frameworks like those by Halpern and Pearl, an agent’s action is considered a cause only if they had both the capacity and the knowledge to act otherwise. Since Jack lacked awareness of the policy change and was manipulated by Emma, his role was non-volitional in the causal chain. The primary cause was Emma’s sabotage, which introduced the critical element of mixing the incompatible varnishes.",

If either Louie makes a 3-point shot or Claire makes a 3-point shot during the game, then they'll win $100 and split it down the middle. Just when the game started, Claire immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. She looked to the basket, focused her shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie, Claire, and their friends continued playing, but as hard as they tried, Louie and Claire couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the buzzer.

Mia needs to do laundry urgently, so she decides to use the dryer at 3 PM on Saturday. Meanwhile, Alex, who just returned from a soccer game, starts his washing machine to clean his uniform. Zoe, who lives on the floor above, also begins drying a load of towels. Ryan, although notified that he is prohibited from using the machines on Saturday afternoons, decides to start his washing machine at the same time as the others.

Her two assistants, Sarah and Luke, handle different aspects of jam production, from chopping fruits to monitoring the cooking process. Since orders have risen sharply, Emma decides to enhance the production process for durability. Reading a research article on food preservation, she learns that a specific preservative can significantly extend product shelf life. Among the options, the article praises two chemicals: C StabiloMax for its effectiveness and natural flavor preservation, and D SafePreserve for its reliability under extreme temperatures. However, the article warns about dangers, particularly chemical interactions, if both are mixed in one batch. After careful consideration, Emma selects C StabiloMax, favoring its compatibility with her kitchen ethos. While making rounds, she speaks to Sarah and emphasizes the importance of using only C StabiloMax in every single batch. To ensure this directive is followed, she asks Sarah to communicate it to Luke and oversee its implementation. Sarah, appearing cooperative, volunteers to take charge of ordering the preservative for both herself and Luke. However, weeks later, Emma notices anomalies in a few jars stored in the inventory: murky discoloration and a slight chemical odor. When these signs worsen in affected jars, Emma becomes alarmed and begins investigating. Confronting both staff members, Sarah admits to a deception: she had deliberately misinformed Luke, telling him to use D SafePreserve. Her intent had been to create mistakes in Luke's work so that he would lose hours, allowing her to take on additional shifts. Sarah herself used only C StabiloMax in her batches. Luke, meanwhile, had wholeheartedly followed Sarah's instructions, using D SafePreserve without realizing it conflicted with Emma's actual directions.

Emma relies on her two baristas, Sarah and David, to run the front counter efficiently. They are responsible for preparing coffee orders and have the flexibility to decide how they split their tasks during their overlapping shifts. After attending a coffee exhibition, Emma was introduced to a new type of coffee bean called Premium Roast 240A, which promises a rich, full-bodied flavor. Emma decides to transition all drink preparations to this new bean to enhance the café's reputation for quality. She discusses this plan with Sarah during the shift change and tells her to make sure the new beans are used exclusively for all orders. Emma instructs Sarah to purchase several bags of Premium Roast 240A and to inform David of the change, so he can follow the same practice on his shift. Sarah immediately agrees but is distracted by a long line of customers and forgets to pass along the message to David. Over the next few weeks, a few regular customers inform Emma about an unusual sour taste in some of their coffee orders. Curious, Emma investigates by sampling multiple drinks during a random visit to her café. She finds that while some drinks taste deliciously smooth and rich, others are overtly sour, with a strong bitter aftertaste. Emma consults Sarah, who admits she neglected to inform David to use the Premium Roast 240A and suspects he has been preparing drinks using the Standard Blend 120B beans that were left over in the café. David confirms this, explaining that he had no idea about the switch and continued with the previous beans stored in the storage area.

The issue occurred either in drinks made *exclusively* with the old beans (David’s) or in cases where the two bean types were accidentally *combined* in the same drink.

Lisa recently attended a coffee workshop where experts recommended switching to a premium coffee bean brand called RoastPure to elevate flavor consistency and quality. One key point she remembered from the workshop was a warning: blending different coffee bean brands can create an unpleasant bitterness in the brew. Determined to follow this advice, Lisa orders a fresh supply of RoastPure beans for the café and decides all drinks should be made exclusively with this brand going forward. She informs Rachel about this new rule before the start of her morning shift, asking her to use only RoastPure and to make sure Sam, who works in the afternoon, is also notified.

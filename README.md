## ðŸ’¡ Overview

**HCR-Reasoner** is a novel framework that integrates the theory of actual causality and cognitive science into large language models for human-like reasoning.

**HCR-Bench** is a newly introduced benchmark designed to evaluate human-like causal reasoning in large language models. It consists 1,093 carefully annotated samples, each providing detailed reasoning steps.

## Features

- **Theory-Guided Actual Causal Reasoning**: AC-Reason incorporates formal AC theory into the reasoning process, offering better interpretability and more accurate causal conclusions.
- **More Comprehensive Evaluation**: AC-Reason includes **AC-Bench**, a benchmark dataset with ~1K carefully annotated samples that provides detailed reasoning steps for testing and improving LLM performance.
- **Improved Model Performance**: AC-Reason demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models on actual causal reasoning tasks on **Big-Bench Hard Causal Judgment** and **AC-Bench**.

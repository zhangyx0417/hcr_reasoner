**Story**: {story}
**Query**: {query}

Based on the story and query of a logic-based causal judgment problem, establish the causal setting as follows.

1. Summarize the **causal events** and **outcome event** based on the story and query.
    - The causal events should causally contribute to the outcome event.
    - The causal events should be minimal/atomic and non-overlapping.
2. Label the **occurrences** and **temporal orders** of events based on the story.
    - Label `occur` as `true` if an event actually occurs.
    - Label `order` as an integer starting from 0, where simultaneous events share the same `order`.
3. Label the **focal causal events** based on the query.
    - If the query asks whether a causal event causes the outcome event, the causal event has `focal = true`.
    - If the query asks whether an agent causes the outcome event, all causal events reflecting the agent's behaviors have `focal = true`.

Return the causal setting in the following JSON format: {{"causal_events": {{CAUSAL_EVENT: {{"occur": true/false, "order": ORDER, "focal": true/false}}, ...}}, "outcome_event": {{OUTCOME_EVENT: {{"occur": true/false, "order": ORDER}}}}}}.
Return only the JSON, without any extra information.
